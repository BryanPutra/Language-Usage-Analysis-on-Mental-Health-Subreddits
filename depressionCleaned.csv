so depressed that i can’t handle anyone’s good news anymore,More-College9062,"i feel like depression has made me the most toxic person i know, seeping negativity at all times. i can’t handle anyone’s good news anymore because it gives  me this pain my heart of how i feel compared to them.  i have to hide so much of what my brain really thinks most of the time to be socially acceptable. it truly is a lonely feeling ;(",42.0,3.0,1602661096.0,depression

"i just told my partner to leave me again, he may actually do it this time, and i want to die",Queen-Keane,"we’ve only been officially together 5 months, but we’ve been talking nearly a year. i always think that i am doing okay but then my low self esteem and mental health issues kick in and i see what a mess i truly am.i love my partner, and i want our relationship to work. but i am convinced that i am absolute shit and that he deserves better. i am convinced that i cannot be the healthy partner he deserves; that i cannot provide him with the happy healthy fulfilling relationship he deserves. i breakdown too much, i talk about myself negatively too much, i do not work a job that allows me to live independently, i do not have much money saved at all, i am awkward, i am anxious, i am ugly, i am selfish, i am a coward, i am just a bad person. i want to be with him, but i also feel obligated to “set him free” so that he can do better. but i do that by constantly telling him the above and asking him to leave me - rather than actually leaving him because i don’t actually want us to break up. but i told him to leave me again tonight. i told him that i would never stop telling him to leave me because i need to protect him and because he deserves better and i am shit. he told me he is devastated. that i am being unbelievably cruel. that i am not freeing him but rather that i am causing him to question if i ever want to be better and causing him to lose his faith in looking for the good in people ever. he told me i don’t want this relationship. he told me not to contact him for a few days while he struggles with all of this.i hate myself. for hurting him. for pushing and pulling him. for being who i am. for maybe finally truly losing him. and i just want to curl into a ball and die. he has every right to leave and he should leave. i just hope he doesn’t. but i don’t know. i ruined things. i completely ruined them. and if by some miracle he doesn’t leave this time, i know he’ll have lost his faith in me and some love for me. and i know i will ruin things again. i want to throw up. i just want to be happy and healthy and to be able to be the the partner he deserves. but i am irredeemably broken. he deserves better. and i can’t believe i hurt him so much. and i hate myself for it. and i want to die.

i wish i could start all over again,shesuredidbleedalot,i want to be 14 again and just redo my high school years again. i’m just not in a good place in my life currently all because i didn’t try hard while in high school. staying at home and doing nothing for my life these past 4 (almost 5 years) has really taken a toll on me where i never thought it would. i can’t even talk to people or keep stable relationships because of this dumb shit show i’m going through y’know. i don’t even see myself living after 25. i really really *really* want to kill myself. i failed the last time. might as well jump off an infamous bridge next time i’m in town visiting family if i’m not dead by then. i’m jealous of everyone i’ve been talking to on social media who is on track of completing college or has a stable job. i’m a nobody. i’m the freak that could never ever be good at anything or good for anyone. i’m a such a burden and i wish my parents would had never constantly call me when i was out trying to end it all. i’m just a mistake in this world and a mistake to every other person who has talked to me before because i’m such an asshole. i could never keep my trap shut for the long run.,23.0,2.0,1638225566.0,depression

i don’t remember these last 2 years?,SiberianMidas,"i (22/f) feel like i was depressed in 2019 and 2020, but this year my depression has been getting worse and now i consider it pretty severe. and i just realized that i barely remember anything these last 2 years, especially 2020. 2020 and early 2021 was a total brain fog and it feels like i jumped forward in time or something. it feels like it didn’t happen and like that year went by in a couple of days. even though my depression is the worst it’s ever been right now i feel like i’m aware for the first time in 2 years. it’s as though i lost 2 years of my life. however i still feel like life is a dream and like it isn’t real, it’s hard to explain but every time i’m in public i just feel as though i’m walking in a dream and my mind feels really foggy. i feel pretty emotionally numb as well, like i’m dead inside most days. my mind is super active, i feel like my thoughts are racing often and it sometimes makes me feel physically nauseous. i can’t think about my past or my life, i have to constantly distract myself not to. i’ve been struggling with my mental health since i was 12 but i’ve never felt this mentally ill in my life. i feel like something is wrong with me. i’m trying to find a job in another city and move out of my parents house to start a new life, but i don’t have any motivation to do anything anymore. i have really bad social anxiety that i’ve had since i was 12 so it makes it a lot harder for me to move out. i’m just on autopilot and i’m really tired. i don’t feel happy or very sad, most of the time i just feel numb and exhausted. sometimes i get really bad anxiety and i have to talk myself into calming down. and sometimes i feel intense emotional pain that’s really hard to deal with, and i can’t even cry. i started therapy last week but i don’t think it will help me, it never has before. i’m not suicidal in the sense that i would never do it because of my family, but if i didn’t have them i would probably have kms already.",6.0,2.0,1574775192.0,depression
do therapists sometimes not want to admit they don’t know how to help their patients?,biblejuice,"i’m reposting here since nobody replied in the other subreddit hey so i’ve been going to therapy for some months and tbh i don’t think my therapist is dumb or that she can’t do her job but sometimes i get the feeling that she doesn’t want to admit that she doesn’t have the tools to help me. i have both an eating disorder and severe depression, but i’ve learned to deal with the eating disorder, meaning that yeah it’s there but it doesn’t consume all my time and energy like it used to (i’m borderline anorexic, not severely underweight but i still heavily restrict but i don’t starve myself)depression on the other way is truly eating me alive, in the past few months i’ve been progressively isolating myself and i lost the ability to focus on the simplest things. i’m consumed by the guilt and despair because i feel like i’m not in charge of my thoughts and actions, i wish i had the energy to focus on my passions and my studies but everything that isn’t lying in bed seems too hard and difficult and i go to therapy weekly to talk about this, i’ve made it clear to my therapist that i can’t seem to feel better and i desperately need to find a way to recover some energy but she almost always shift the conversation back to my eating disorder or the relationship with my family. which isn’t what i want to talk about, or what truly is ruining my daily lifeshe’s very anti psychiatry and anti depressants (in a way i am too since my experience with psychiatrists and meds has been only disappointing: i have taken antidepressants for years and they have never done anything to help my mood or my ed) but i somewhat get the feeling that she doesn’t really know how to truly help me so instead she chooses to focus on what she thinks she can help me with. am i paranoid or do you think that this can happen: for therapists to be to “prideful” to admit they can’t help one of their patients?",86.0,39.0,1623963937.0,depression

depressed and lonely - please help,VeechuRoti,"hi, just for some background i am 19f and am in my first term of university. i have never really had friends before this. in primary school, people did not like me. i had friends but obviously children end up slipping and i realised that sometimes i was the butt of the joke.  in secondary school. i became less shy and tried talking to people more but then one day when talking to a classmate, i realised my classmates found me annoying (which there were signs for). i became really quiet after that and withdrew because i realised people were just acting nice to my face but then talking about me behind my back. i started talking to a girl in one of my lessons and after a while, she literally wrote an article about how i was talkative and annoying mentioning my name and publishing it on the internet. she changed it after i shared this out of frustration to the few people i actually somewhat spoke too and they agreed that it was rude. i think they took matters into their own hands and wrote some messages on the group chat talking about how rude doing it was to do something like this (but not specifically to or about her) which prompted her to change it. in the sixth form, i hung out with more people but all they really did was laugh at me (even if nothing really had happened). i talked to people in lessons but nobody really cared about me. i thought i has a friend when some guy invited me to sit with him when my usually lab partner was not in, talked to me a lot and texted me but then he just did not acknowledge me for three months. throughout this, i thought i had one friend but i think it is becoming more and more clear i am just something for her to dump her stories to or rant to. i remember she sent me screenshots of her talking to a guy and they mocked me telling me my wedding cake would have maths equations on it.somehow, i got into a competitive university even though most people thought i would not be the type of person to get in. i try to talk to people but find it hard to connect with other people and their interests. i either get blamed even if it was their fault or talked at. also, the same person likes to highlight how small she is and how she gets a lot of male attention but also calls herself 'fat' which i find triggering since right before university i was restricting a lot and as a result of eating more have gained 20kg. she is also quite bossy and after i highlighted i did not like being treated this way she said it was me so now i don't know who's at fault. i feel really stupid at my university and it is not imposter syndrome because i do not doubt my abilities - i just feel like i have lost the will to try hard. the same girl tells me i look like i have no idea what's happening even though she talks over other people and is wrong a lot as well. i literally have two friends. one is from my old school who invites me to places but going there always reminds me of how alone i am and how i can never relate to people.i know people tell you to go out and meet new people which is what i have tried. i have gone to societies and talked to people and when i feel the worst has decided to reconnect with old friends or people i have talked to. however, even though i can talk to people, nobody ever wants to hang out or be friends. the other friend likes to hang out twice but it is usually with other people and i feel like the third wheel a lot.most nights at university i cry myself to sleep. i have contemplated suicide a little but know it will hurt my parents too much and that i have come so far that having few friends seems like a not good enough reason. however, i am finding it hard to cope. i have always felt unattractive and have rarely got compliments and i know i am definitely unattractive. the only people who have remotely appeared interested in me were creepy, lonely tutors when i was 16. people my age probably think i am overweight and ugly. i remember once a girl in my class saw a photo of me saying i was cute and then was like to the guy who i mentioned earlier 'isn't she cute' and he just remained silent. i know i can lose weight and lost 25kg last year however i nearly and probably already had slipped into an eating disorder.i just feel so empty and sometimes i feel so much pain that i can feel it in my chest. i feel like it is me - maybe i'm rude, bossy and inconsiderate but i try to be nice and then afterwards treat others the same way they treat me. my flatmates seem annoyed i implied they were loud at midnight but i had not complained of so long and they were shouting in the kitchen. i thought i was making friends with another flatmate but then she would completely ignore me when other flatmates were in the room which after a month prompted me to withdraw from her. this could be low self-esteem but i think it is more like frustration that people might think i am unreasonable e.g. implying flatmates are loud even though in a flat it would be nice to be considerate of everyone and they can party and make noise in the kitchen preferably not full-on continuously shout and scream at the top of their lungs. i don't even know who i am anymore -

socializing feels like acting,mustydusterman,"i’m terribly alone. within the past years i isolated myself and find myself with very little friends, and i definitely spend many days at a time talking to no one. i’m in a weird middle space, though, where i definitely feel lonely, i long to belong, but i don’t have the mental stability to even try to belong right now. i can only describe trying to make friends or talking to my old ones as acting, like i’m forcing my eyes wider and holding a grin and working on overload to try to come up with the words to pretend to be invested. it’s not even social anxiety, i just see how fake social situations are in its entirety and i’m just losing hope in caring.",15.0,0.0,1497889007.0,depression
bad feelings,composer13,"i cannot shake these awful feelings. i get very anxious, paranoid that people are focusing their attention on me at all times. i feel like i am being watched all of the time. i feel like famous people are thinking about me quite often even if i have never met them in person or even if i've never interacted with them online. i go through a repeated cycle of one negative thought after another. these thoughts are always rooted in the feeling that i am always the victim, that i am being attacked or persecuted in some sort of way. to make matters worse, before i started taking wellbutrin i was frequently having bad dreams where i was always being attacked by people, things, objects, ghosts, demons etc. i am prone to extreme irritability. although i am not violent towards anyone, my temper and my emotional state can be very extreme. i get overwhelmed by my environment. the sound of a car revving it's motor can irritate me beyond belief.",3.0,0.0,1598750255.0,depression

have you traveled or finally did something that you thought would “fix you” or bring you some sort of joy but you’re still severely depressed?,sadpinkgirl,"because same here. i went to disneyland for the first time ever 5 years ago when i was 18 when my depression started and i literally didn’t care about being there at all what so ever. i was so depressed i just didn’t care about being there, i had absolutely no energy for it and all i kept thinking was how i wanted to go home. well anyways recently i went to vegas with my friends at 23 years old this year in may to see if it would bring me joy or cheer me up somehow.. and yeah you guys already know the answer don’t you. i just wanted to leave that whole entire time  and just go home. being there was so exhausting. everything feels exhausting to me now that i’m depressed even things that are “suppose to be fun” the only thing i find enjoyable and fun is going to sleep.",4.0,13.0,1622318928.0,depression

ive been having breakdown for like thirty minutes now during class in school,Trixic_bb,"nobody really noticed, but meh. i feel like im faking it because i never attempted suici*e and only ever talk about it. i feel like i mess up everything i do.i cant have even the good parts of being depressed neurodivergent gay teen, like cool style, forever ocs (thats what i call making my own characters id write stories about, lots of now successful authors used to have those), writing fanfiction or being passionate about something that way in general, making longterm friends online, mastering one single hobby to perfection, having a special interest show/book etc etc. i have none of that. i just can't have the good things either, even though its questionable how good they are, but i feel like i lack the universal experience.and when something good comes, even for a short while, i overthink it until im sad. my mind forces me to imagine my best friend dying. i pushed myself into hating a book that once made me happier than anything because of online critics. i'm in a circle and i can't get out of it. i tried going to therapy but when i tried to make third appointment, the therapist stopped responding and left me on ""read"" for over a month now. i'm in an environment that doesn't let me heal, nor can i escape it without huge future consequences.everybody only ever says ""itll get better eventually"" or some version of that but im so tired of waiting. i dont even know what i want from this, i guess its a vent. im sorry if reading this has bothered you",2.0,3.0,1610360669.0,depression

depression… was it adhd all along??,hallouminati_,"hello everyone,29 m… thought i’d share something with you about my mental health/depression journey. i’ve been depressed for about 4 years or so. i’ve tried anti-depressants, been in therapy for 3 and a myriad of self help books and “fixes” (such as exercise & healthy eating) all to no avail.after wrestling with my local doctor here in the uk and pushing back on my therapist that it was just normal to feel like this, i ventured to a private gp who after 30 minutes flagged adhd and referred me to a leading psych in the uk.a couple of consultations, i now have an adhd diagnosis and the psych believes that my depression symptoms may be a by product of it. i would have never thought i had adhd - and i may have autism too which i am going to do further exploration into next year. in my self diagnosis prowess, i suspect i have been trying to conform to “normal” in adulthood and have been robbed of joy and energy through doing so - or so i hope :)why am i sharing this? firstly probably for sympathy as my depression feels extremely real, and has done for years. but also to highlight for anyone else to turn the adhd stone over and get checked if you have the symptoms.has anyone else been diagnosed or thinking about getting checked?thank you, much love!",3.0,1.0,1553162033.0,depression
i(26yr m) regret having kids because i every day i have this intrusive thought about how badly i want to die,Universaltarget,"***trigger warning***this is a dud account for my own privacy.i(26yr m) regret having kids because i every day i have this intrusive thought about how badly i want to die, to just disappear completely somehow. i have 2, a 5yr girl and a 1yr boy..mom and i split up last year(she has custody while i get them on weekends), which is totally fine for me as i called it off long ago it just wasn’t a good relationship. it’s not what bothers me..my dad killed himself in my parents old backyard jan of 2018 and i haven’t been able to recover from the trauma of finding his body lying lifeless against the fence that he and i had built together. after that i picked up a short lived drinking problem to ignore what i was going through emotionally and mentally and later attempted my own suicide that ultimately left me with a huge scar across my forehead to remind me how i failed ending up in a mental institution for a week and now i look like a fucking wreck. i no longer feel appealing, in anyway shape or form and i contemplate dying every day out of sheer loneliness and to escape the despair inside my head. i don’t know what to do anymore, i can’t afford therapy and i have 0 will to do anything with my life anymore. it’s like i’d rather sit at my desk staring at a blank wall and think of how great it would be if i were to catch some nasty illness or better yet randomly shot dead because i don’t know if i can do it myself. i’ve completely lost interest in every part of my life. i love my kids with all of my heart and it breaks me to know how i feel about life knowing the damage it left when my dad decided his fate. i can’t stand the fact that i brought two beautiful people into this world and i wanna take myself out of it. i’ve tried acting like this is normal but i’m realizing that i’m tired, and i’m fighting with myself over this thought and i don’t know how long i can keep going.",5.0,8.0,1638766169.0,depression
