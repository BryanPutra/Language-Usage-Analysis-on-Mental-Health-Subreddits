to the love of my life: an explanation,Jamiebedford01gb,"you were always right. im intense, im clingy, im needy. i will never not be in disbelief that i'm no longer with you. i think you have seen how calm i can be - perhaps even too laid back - but we both know that's only when things go smoothly. life unfortunately isn't like that and i can't react like this every time there is a challenge. i wish i wasn't like this because i know how unhealthy it is for everyone but it's the brain i was blessed with.these days i'm now have this weird sort of anhedonia. i know i have many things that used to make me happy that don't directly involve you but yet i dont see the point, the motivation, and i can't enjoy anything if i know i can't tell you about the thing that is making me happy, the thing that i did, the goal i'm working towards, the thing i achieved, the emotion i felt, or the thing i laughed at. nothing makes me feel anymore. i have lost all motivation to do anything but try and be with you and that is wrong. and as much as i am sorry for what this will cause, this is why i have to do this. my only drive is to be with you and therefore i'm scared that all my future has in store is harassing you, releasing my anger and desperation on you, and hurting you. this is for myself in the sense i don't want to spend my days being known as an abuser or as a convict. but it's also for you. i want the best for you and i don't want to hurt you any longer. i want you to be the happiest that you can be. and i know this will cause pain initially but in the long run i think you will be better off compared to if i was here.we both promised we would never leave and i know i have let you down in doing this. i know i could carry on heartbroken and try and rebuild the pieces back in my life i could. but i don't want to. i just don't have the will power anymore. i am so weak and in too much pain. i will slowly get stronger just for my mind to shoot me back down again and again. i hope you will forgive me. i believe it is the best thing for both of us. i always wanted you to be happy and i would do anything to make that happen. and this is what it takes. i have always been willing to die for you and this is one of those rare circumstances where the person has to commit to that oath. i love you, emily. i know you loved me too at one point, i really do. and i feel so blessed to have experienced your love. it made me the happiest i have ever been. i guess i never realised how unfulfilled and incomplete i was before you came into my life. and i know in the end your love had changed. at least to extent it wasn't strong enough to want us to work. to want to try. to battle through the difficult, unnatural times for a future with me. but that doesn't change my feelings for you. i am in such awe of you that nothing ever could make me not think you are the most special person in the universe. you are far too good for me. you deserve so much better. i love you too much to deny you that. i hope you remember me and the good times we had together. the growth we had as a couple. the things that we brought to each other. the things we changed about one another. the new hobbies we shared. the life we had. i hope you will think of me positively. one last kiss, jamie x[link to weyes blood - 'be free'] - one of my favourite songs, i love it even as much as my love for tame impala.",4.0,1.0,1573154129.0,suicideWatch

i don't have the will to live and the reason why i still stay is slowly fading...,Ganfaraway,"buckle up this might be a bit long...&#x200b;the first time i tried to kill myself was when i was around 8 or 9 years old, i tried to cut my neck with scissors but it wasn't even sharp enough to make a wound on my neck. ever since then i've always wanted to die because of multiple reasons, for instance, i disappointed my family because i wasn't part of the honor roll that year, i feel that i'm such a burden to everyone around me and a lot more which would make this post too long if i ever list it out, but i couldn't bring myself to actually kill myself because i would think about the problems that my parents would have to face when i'm gone. i'm currently 18 years old and still feel the same but now, i feel like my desire for death is slowly taking over my sympathy towards my parents. i never really had close relations with others and if i ever die, i know that only my parents would be the ones who would have to deal with all the processes they need to do, for example, preparing my funeral and whatnot. i don't really want to commit suicide as well because i know that it will only stain our family name and my parents, i also don't want them to feel bad or guilty for what i will possibly do, and i also worry about who will take care of them when i'm gone. if you will ask me why i don't go to therapy, well in our country (here in the philippines), therapy isn't really something that is easily available, i also don't want to tell my parents about this as they are ill and i don't want to be more of a burden than i already am and even online therapy is expensive, and i would prefer if we use our money for my parents' medications instead. i don't have friends that i can really fully talk about this and i don't want to talk to our college counselor or any teachers because they'll most likely tell my parents about it. both my parents and friends know that i'm depressed, but i never really fully shared in-depth about how i don't want to stay here anymore. not only that but recently my palpitations and chest aches had become more frequent. i was brought to the er yesterday because i almost lost consciousness and i couldn't breathe, that time i felt that i've become a heavier burden for my parents, i know at the back of my head that both my physical and mental health have gotten worse. i'm an insomniac and had been since i was 8-9 years old which probably had terribly affected my health. i just don't know what else to do to want to stay here, i've also lost any desire for material things, i don't enjoy the hobbies i used to do, i'm not passionate about the course that i'm taking and about my studies, and all that is left is feeling worried about what will happen to my parents when i'm gone which even that is slowly fading away. anyways...i only wanted to post this so that at least i'll be able to say this to someone else...i guess i'm also yearning to be heard and comforted by someone but i've already accepted that that's just not going to happen.",3.0,0.0,1550671104.0,suicideWatch

venting my feelings,Eluest,so i’m a 24 m and every now and then i erupt into pretty depressing sessions of just despair and crying alone to the point of wanting to be dead. i’m only passively suicidal not actively but i can’t help but feel like maybe that’ll change someday. i have a suicide note written on my phone that i continuously update every now and then and it makes me feel some kind of comfort but at the same time feel despair that this may be my only true way out of this misery. i’ve never done therapy before and really want to because i know i need it and i’ve been trying to find one but it’s so difficult with the pandemic and all. either there’s no one available or nobody answers. a lot of these problems and feelings stem from my what i’d consider to be severe anxiety and how it controls my life. the most recent thing is that i’ve entered a relationship that i’m happy with but my anxiety leaves me feeling like i’m not fully enjoying the relationship and motions. this anxiety leaves me feeling like i’m not good enough and like i’m making mistakes left and right and reading to much into things etc etc and afraid the relationship will crumble at any given moment and i’ll be left all alone again. i understand these feelings are counter productive and self destructive to a relationship and it’s why i’m trying to control them even when it’s really difficult. it’s the kind of feelings that arose or got more severe when my gf and i talked about where we’re at and what needs to be worked on and improved between us because we both want a long term relationship with each other and and that’s when i truly realize how much work really needs to be put into a relationship for it to work and develop in a healthy way and i’m just afraid that i won’t live up to that. im certainly working on shaking off these feelings of self doubt and self destructiveness but still. also i’m trying to change my life around from my current place because i’m not satisfied with where i’m at but i’m afraid i might never be able to change it despite how much i really want to and i’m currently trying. it’s the kind of thing that makes me feel hopeless and feel like if this is my life until i die then what’s even the point?,8.0,2.0,1635302747.0,suicideWatch

need some help,Wichita92,"everyone…i really need your help. i’ve never been the one to turn to the internet and random people for reassurance or advice, but i’m in a really low spot.i’ve read almost every single thing about suicide at this point. the devastation it causes to loved ones, the permanence of an unthinkable action. and even though there are days where i feel so depressed that i sometimes wish i wasn’t alive anymore, i could never ever go through with an action that would hurt those around me.that’s the problem, you see i’m very aware of my actions. im very aware that i have a family who loves me dearly and would do anything for me. i’ve voiced my depression and anxiety to them for years and have been very transparent. i’ve seen about 8 different psychiatrists, therapists, psychologist and social workers and nothing has helped. i’ve read self help books. i’ve tried multiple ssri’s and antidepressants, anti-anxiety meds and adhd meds (all of which had no reaction or made my condition worse…aka the worst depression i’ve ever felt). i’ve worked out consistently and made dietary changes. i’ve done so much and i know deep down is that any self-help needs me to stay diligent but i never put the work in (which can be blamed a lot on my diagnosed adhd). part of my depression is that i always feel lazy. i slack off at work, yet still continuously get promoted. i never do things if they’re too hard, i always try to find a shortcut.i hate that i need to have things a certain way or obsess over thoughts and consequences of my actions (i also have diagnosed ocd).truth be told, i just hate myself more and more. i was bullied for years growing up, i didn’t have many friends until i went to college. then i had a bunch and a girlfriend for a few years. when i left college i had made new friends and kept some. now ive lived in a new state for a couple years, have hardly made friends with anyone despite joining clubs, sports teams, work outings and so forth. i’m extremely social, i used to have no anxiety about conversation with total strangers and now, for the first time ever, i’m more and more nervous. i can’t meet a girl for the life of me. every time i do, they end up being an alcoholic, manipulative or don’t have enough in common with me.i just feel lost. i’m not happy anymore, at least not with any normal consistency like i used to have. i don’t want to continue, but suicide isn’t an option. i try to do things for myself all the time. i treat myself to things, like vacations and such. but i take them alone, so i feel like shit when i’m on them.i don’t know what to do anymore. prescriptions are no longer an option in my book (too many bad experiences and i’ve seen pharmaceuticals wreck havoc in my family). i’ve tried multiple holistic things too like ashwaghanda, and others to no avail. i have no motivation to see another counselor, or keep up with things like cbt.i know this just feels like a rambling vent…and for any who have made it this far i really appreciate you taking the time to listen to a stranger. quite frankly, i’m not sure i even know what i’m looking for by posting this. but i needed to say something because i’m hurting so much inside.",14.0,2.0,1638741849.0,suicideWatch

please help me figure out what to do (sorry for long post),im-extremelyconfused,"i need some help figuring out what to do in my present situation and i need some information too. tw//suicide, sh, depressioni’ve kind of been dissatisfied with life since i was a little kid, i kind of thought that’s just what life was like. but when everybody started calling me depressed (friends, family, etc.) i realized there was something to life that i was missing. people are supposed to feel happy and cared for, and i never have.it’s been a long slow progression into self harm, starting with very unhealthy habits that disregard my mental health and safety then moving to hitting myself, then eventually cutting myself. that one took off fast and i feel like my depression got worse quick because of it. my depression also probably got worse due to spending 2.5 years mostly without going outside. and addiction, trauma, the 4 therapists that kind of fucked me over and last but not least, lotta hate for being trans.so now i feel like i’ve reached a crossroads. i’ve spent weeks now trying not to end it all, trying to hold on to the recognition i have of my own value as a human being. all while telling nobody about how i’m really feeling, because i’m afraid i’d get caught in a tight position. i’ve been in a state of limbo, trying to figure out which way i’m going to go for these few weeks. and i still haven’t genuinely made up my mind, but every day i feel myself getting pulled more towards just doing it, just ending my life. in the space of a week i will be at a place where i see no reason to continue living, i can just tell. at this moment in time, however, i have a decision i can still make: do i let that happen and have my future self end it all, or do i check myself in to a hospital and tell them i’m gonna kill myself?i don’t want to go to the psych ward for so many reasons, but if i have to, i can look past most of them. it’s the ones i can’t look past that are the problem. these are the ones that i’d rather die than experience. they include:    -will i get hate for being trans?    -will they stop my medication (hrt) against my will?    -will i be abused in some way by the staff/other patients?    -will i have to stay there long enough (till march) that i get transferred to the adult ward?    this one’s big:    -will i have to be naked in front of someone during the intake?those are all i can think of for now. i’m really worried about receiving false information about these questions and getting in one of these situations. these situations would give me lifelong trauma and i wouldn’t want to continue life (after psych ward) if these happen, so i’ll be done for even if i go there with false info about these, it won’t “save me” to get false info.if any trans people have experience in a psych ward please let me know what it was like, especially if you live in a major east coast city, cause i know it can vary from place to place. if i go in there and i’m treated really poorly, i’ll probably never get out with the intent to stay alive.if you’re still reading, don’t worry, you’re near the end of the post.i have a therapist and i trust them (lucky me!) but i can’t talk about any of this with them because i’m sure i’d be in a hospital and it wouldn’t even be close to my decision. they don’t even know i self-harm. maybe if i did, though, they would know a “good” hospital, who’s psych ward is not as bad to lgbtq patients. or maybe there’s some lgbtq center i could go to to find a hospital that’s not as bad.honestly, and this is the hard part to say, i do almost care about myself and i know i have people who care about me. i don’t really want to die. but unfortunately i feel like these are my few options. if the world were a better place, i would surely survive through the end of this year and longer. but this is the way the world works and here i have to pick between death and… the us healthcare system. please someone try and help me out, i have nothing left to care about here except those who care about me.my life is not going to mysteriously turn around. i don’t even want to get better. i don’t really have anything to care about in life, i just sit around daydreaming and feeling sorry for myself. there’s a lot more to say about my situation but this post is long enough as is. please ask if you have any questions.ps: i don’t wanna die cause i wanna keep writing poems. k thx for your help in advance ❤️edit: now i’m really happy i think there’s something wrong with my brain",4.0,0.0,1612522677.0,suicideWatch

exhausted,PipoBoloti,"  so fucking tired. have a history of suicide in my family. grandpa on father's side and grandma on mother's side both offed themselves when my parents were children. my brother blew his brains out in the family kitchen over 20 years ago (i was 12, he was 21 and i remember my histerical mom yelling at me to pick up his brains in a bowl so they could save him).  i always promised myself that i wouldn't make her go through that again, since it pretty much ended our family (parents got divorced after his death) and made her life even more difficult but i can't find the strength to keep going just so i don't make her sad. yes that may sound inconsiderate but i haven't been too close with her since i left my hometown at 18. never had a relationship with my dad to begin with, my brother was my father figure.  my 35th birthday is in less then two weeks and i don't think i'm gonna make it. ended an on and off relationship of yeara a couple of months ago. cut contact with all my friends over the last couple of weeks due to severe depression that i've been battling with since i was a teen (after losing my brother) and to get them accustomed to me absence in their lives. stopped showing up to years long therapy last week also. too exhausted to keep crying out for help and only hearing it will ""get better"" when everything gets objectively worse. won't even go into the crippling debt.  called my parents today just to hear their voice maybe one last time, they didn't pick up as usual, so i wrote my mom an email but didn't have much to say, just hoping she can forgive me and i'll send instructions on how to get into my accounts and shit.  not sure how i'm going to do it yet, but worst case scenario would be to just jump out of the window. live on the 13th floor and hope that's going to be enough. i'm so scared of surviving with a worse quality of life and the shame.  anyways, sorry for the long text, just wanted to get it off of my chest and i feel like some of you here can relate. thanks for reading.update edit: got a call from my mother after she read the email. she was extremely upset saying she doesn't deserve this, that i should send this sort of upsetting thing to my father. how she had a rough life, lost a son but was still able to live. dad called and told be not to be a coward. so yeah, kind of regret even trying to communicate my feelings. just feel embarrassed and even more suicidal.",6.0,2.0,1638216920.0,suicideWatch

please help ;( i put a bag over my head and i'm fearing the resulting brain damage now,FinalEscapeAttempt,"yesterday evening i was really sad and i just wanted to know what it would feel like to end it all. so i put a bag over my head, lying on my bed. the material was cloth. i don't know how long i had it on my head. could be anything from 30 seconds to 3 minutes i guess, i really couldn't count the time in that situation. the bag was not sealed, there was space for air to come in yet that space was also rather small. i didn't have any shortness of breath, i only recognized breathing flat. i pulled off the bag when i realized the possibilty of occuring brain damage as i remembered hearing something like this about someone who attempts suicide by hanging themselves. that being sad i didn't pull it off out of discomfort, rather out of fear. yet, i felt some slight headache and little dizziness afterwards. i felt a light tingling sensation in my left arm right before pulling it off. i did not go unconcious but i am wondering if brain damage is possible to occur while staying concious in a low-oxygen environment or how likely it is to have happened. thoughout the evening, my head felt clouded, couldnt think clearly- probably still can't and i still have a slight headache though i don't think the headache must come from this event. i didn't notice any blue on my hands or lips, yet i also didn't look for it specigically afterwards and it was dark in my room so hard to notice. 5 min later or so i was in the bathroom, there i didn't see any blue. is permanent brain damage likely if right now, i can't think clearly and feel slow while reading or thinking?",1.0,2.0,1623606822.0,suicideWatch

im tired,Inevitable_Stress_42,"hi everyone, hope this day found ya'll well.this is kinda a throwaway, idk yet i guess. im so tired guys, i am at my limit... to keep it short(ish) ive been struggling with suicide. started late 2017, i still in my 'boot' stage in the army (11b). i was married at time to a pretty girl & i had (have) a massive loving family.i got sent to jump school jan 2018 but was injured on our first drop. hit the ground okay but when i fell to my side i smacked my hip on a small sharp rock and i couldnt move. couldnt walk right so i stayed for a while, no rehab or anything, was just told it was inflammation. got back to the unit and since i was basically on a dead man profile (also the co kinda hated seeing me not go to the field) i was medically reclassed. i was e3 so i didnt know anything or anyone so i just kinda took it...still kind of in shock of the whole thing still. got reclassed to an aviation mos, which sounds much better than a grunt right? well the thing is i always struggled academically & mechanically...i hardly passed high school, even after buckling my ass down for 2 years and a super senior year. by the skin of my teeth. anyways, first day of aviation ait, we went over a general idea on what we will be learning/doing. holy fuck i was a deer in headlights. everyth'ing looked so complicated, much much more than i could take. that scared thee living shit out of me. ""oh my god this is gonna be high school but worse""...sure as shit, it was.w/o exaggerating, i must have failed 65-70% of the course's tests and quizzes. hours upon hours of re-training. the instructors really did try and i appreciate them for that, solid ncos over there tbh. during that time, do to all the failures, wife getting pissed at me because i came home crying everyday cause i kept failing. kept being told by her that im not even trying. parents try to keep me going which kinda worked. then my dad was diagnosed with stg 4 prostate cancer. mom called me bawling, ""you have to come home"" ""we dont know if he has time"" ""its in all this bones"" ""pls come home"". which also fucked my focus, wife then called me a mamas boy for wanting to go home instead of a 3 grand trip to the bajamas. i then attempted suicide 3 times cause i couldnt take the pressure on 3 fronts. twice by hanging and one by pills. not enough pills to do it, started choking and stopped, then the rope (by old blue cord) broke.mid 2018, alaska, new duty station. ""graduated"" the aviation course, now a 15 series. job is hell. idk what im doing, get yelled at, smoked, beaten etc because i cant do my job right. no one gets it nor cares, except an old grunt. from the corps, hes seen and done shit. he notices my frustrations and my early signs of alcoholism. he takes me in his tiny circle, hes great. helps me on my tasks and ate the bullet for me 3 or 4 times. hes hard, a bit evil and basically a dick to everyone, but he took me in. anyways the bottle still gets me and im drunk 5 out of 7 days. wife starts beating me for not wanting to do anything & starts limiting my rights at home. including games, tv, phone. try pills, not enough. i got out and now i am divorced thankfully. i got a shitty warehouse job where i had shouting matches with my arrogant boss. h was bad, yet i was not in a good spot in my life. he prob wasnt either. quit less than a year there and am now working a a doctor's call center. i was thriving until recently...long story short i moved up the later, doctors office bought out by a corporation, nazi-like rules kick in. limited breaks and demotions w/more responsibility with less pay. as you can imagine, ppl got pissed and started leaving, piling my responsibilities and tasks. <--this is where im at. its sunday night and my new responsibilities/tasks with lesser breathing room and break time kick in tomorrow. my glock is right here and im so tired of putting my brain through this. im tired of the panic attacks, the stuttering, the mixing up of words, lack of social skills/ambitions that used to flourish. i love my large family, every single one. but i cant, i just fucking cant guys. i really dont want to die guys, ill miss my dog so very much but my head & chest ache like no other. my threshold is wavering and i cannot hold the line any longer.",2.0,1.0,1638755075.0,suicideWatch

i've felt lifeless for the past decade,spiceydicey111,"to begin here's some background - i've seen mental health professionals in the past, and i've never taken the step further for diagnosis. i take over-the-counter anxiety relievers from time to time when my symptoms worsen with minimal improvement in my mental state.1. college is miserable; no matter how hard i try, i feel no passion for pursuing. i'm already failing three classes with the semester coming to an end, and my parents become abusive when i fall behind in school. ever since i was 11, i was told i wouldn't amount to anything but a fast-food worker and constantly discussing throwing me out to the streets if i dared fall behind in college. school has only made me feel miserable for the past few years. i can't seem to find happiness or satisfaction in anything i complete, i lived my life trying to satisfy my parent's vision for me and in the meantime, i have fallen behind on my own happiness. i've spent my whole life lamenting about a ""hopeless future"" so much that it has only led me to this downfall. sure people have told me grades can improve or it's just a rough start but at the end of it all i don't know what i want to pursue yet. the semester is almost over and my grades are unrecoverable (i reached out to the profs).2. i got out of a nearly one-year relationship that destroyed all my friendships around me. the woman i was with harassed every valuable connection out of my life and ensured my connections in life are abysmal. these friends don't even want me back, i was pressured into making it seem cutting them off was my own doing entirely. not only that but i live day to day with the trauma this individual has caused me. the first time i tried leaving her she blackmailed me with false allegations to coax me into taking her back, and when she found out i discussed the abuse with my closest friends she attempted to push this story out there to ruin me until i cut off my friends, now that she dumped me and i blocked her i'm in constant fear of this arising again due to whatever random flash of resentment she may have3. it's gotten to a point where i have become emotionless in everything in my life. every interaction/expression feels simulated. it's hard for me to convince myself anything around me has concrete meaning or consequences behind it, i hardly respond to any of my remaining friends, i have absolutely no more desire to do so. i have no desire to seek new friends and i feel absolutely nothing when i make new connections, i feel horrible faking every emotion - i sit there caring and comforting for those around me when i can hardly feel any compassion in me to do so. i'm just piloting myself to fake emotions i think i should have normally that are just nonexistent. i went from dreaming of becoming a therapist to hardly being able to feel any sort of empathy for those around me, as f'd up as it sounds.for years my life has been living to satisfy those around me, and my idea of satisfaction and happiness only falls out of line of those i am trying to please. i'm not in any dire rush to end it all, but it is all that has been on my mind since i was young and as of recently it has only gotten much much worse.",1.0,0.0,1518918480.0,suicideWatch

i’d have to uber more, and still work enough hours to keep health insurance (yeah yeah, i should have been going to school years ago and have all time available for working now) to continue school. i’d also have to get vaccinated to be allowed to go back (parents are really against it saying it’s part of a new world order, and i’m still concerned about side effects of it).i’m so alone, don’t see how my life can flip anytime soon. i don’t just do it, because i’m scared of possible hell, and just leaving permanently…….my family talking about how america, and not just america, but the whole world, will be under a “new world order and one world government” in just a few years, and that the “antichrist” will take over, and that it’s the literal biblical end of the world from the book of revelations.who knows if that’s true, i’m not sure. i lost faith in god over 10 years ago, ironically because i couldn’t get a girlfriend (i was 13 or 14) but i have a lot more reasons to doubt in god or existence of god now, and all those reasons aren’t even about me personally, but also the world at large.i remember when i got back from the psych facility, after 3 months, nobody even acknowledged that i was gone, i wasn’t even bullied about it. i imagined blowing my brain out and everyone cheering.today, 10 years later, at nearly 26 years old, at my pathetic job, i know that even there, even now, most of my coworkers would show concern and definitely acknowledge my absence (even know a job wouldn’t allow you back after being gone that long, even if you were hospitalized, i doubt the law would protect you from being terminated even then, at-will employment, yay)i’m not even real friends with everyone, but at least work friends? people like me enough to care (or at least pretend to care) if something happened to me, they’d ask me if i was ok, what happened to me.i’ve told some of my coworkers i wanted to kill myself (as a joke) and gotten “omg why no don’t do that”, even back when i was 17-18, i had a female friend constantly telling me to not think like that.it’d destroy my mom, but i’m sorry, i can’t keep living just so other people don’t break down. i don’t want to keep being dependent on you.i want to be able to have my own life, experience intimacy, feel what romantic and sexual intimacy with a woman/women is like, and hopefully before i’m 30 or 40 something.i never thought i’d live to see a pandemic outbreak or “global/socialist takeover”.imagine leaving the world with something as shocking as a live-streamed shooting myself in the head or heart, that’d have to make worldwide news.i’m sorry, i’m just losing it………..",4.0,10.0,1622329603.0,suicideWatch

this brings me peace,Euphoric-Industry-63,"(throwaway account)by the 8th of december i will be dead.i don’t really know why i’m writing this but i guess it’s my last chance of hope. i was diagnosed with psychosis in 2019. i gained a lot of weight since my diagnosis due to using food as comfort. which turned into weed and cigarettes and it’s been unbearable since. i’ve had therapy many times in the last 2 years and there would always be a explosion of hope. i would eat better, stopped smoking, exercising but i always go back to weed. nothing could fulfil that void of content and happiness i’ve been missing.i’ve never loved myself and i always give myself high expectations and rules. which i learnt about in therapy but the false happiness that came with weed just made everything feel so calm. i’ve been looking for hope in “god” but my prayers are never answered. i now know that change won’t come unless i do something but i’m tired of fighting. i know this is the only choice for me. i’ve learnt people don’t get rid of their problems but only distract themselves. i want to be able to relax and feel happy and content with life. not just bombarding myself with distractions. but i’ve given up. i know myself more than anyone and i know i’ll just go back to weed. i can’t bear the thought of feeling like this and waiting to feel happy again. i wake up everyday wishing i hadn’t. the first thing i feel every morning is dread  and sadness. and i’m tired. i can’t be bothered to do anything but kill myself. things i used to love don’t work.i don’t understand why i have to suffer and live on just because of how my loved ones will feel when i’m gone. this world isn’t worth living for. it’s corrupt and nothing will change. so what’s the point. i’ve been through too many up and down cycles and on wednesday i will finally stop it and bring peace to myself.i’m gutted to miss spider-man nwh so enjoy it for me 💖",4.0,4.0,1638594171.0,suicideWatch

last woman definitely not standing,Jewel_of_Isis,"i'm more metaphorically right now huddled in a corner, sitting with my head resting against the wall in an empty room alone. in a few days, for me, what i like to label ""family mourning day"" is approaching. it was my father-in-law's birthday. i spent a few hours with him at the home unknowingly before he passed away. i also spent some time with my grandmother whom i knew was going to pass away soon and it was going to be my last time with her. she died weeks later. since then, earlier family losses and subsequent ones are slowly being gathered as it's harder emotionally to mark each one individually. i've lost 7 family members, including my beloved husband and most recently my mother within the past 3 and a half years.  i'm the last member of my family who i've cared for and loved. and the temptation to join them on the other side is strong right now. all i have left over is the stuff that belongs to my family and myself and if i died, my father would just get rid of it all. i've already promised him that i'd take care of it so he wouldn't have to after i'm gone. yes, he's already expecting that he'll outlive me. just if i have to deal with this toxic bastard for the rest of my life, it's not worth it.",2.0,1.0,1427011888.0,suicideWatch

im deeply unhappy and suicidal,GirondinsBordeaux,"this might be longer than i intend so im sorry for anybody who chose to read, and i apologize if this is the wrong place to post this because ik a lot of what i want to say isnt even comparable to what other people postthere are some days when i go to bed where i promise myself that i will wake up early and be productive, where ill work out and eat properly and get a lot of work done and study hard for my final exams. but whenever i wake up i can never do that, i stay in bed for hours on my phone, wasting time and not doing anything at all, not talking to my friends or family but instead watch reels on instagram or youtube videos. when i do wake up i take a shower and convince myself that once i get clean ill eat and do some work, but what ends up happening is that ill have a multivitamin for breakfast and just sit in my room for hours thinking, not doing anything at all. i couldn't sleep last night, so i just sat in the corner of my closet in the dark, and i constantly have recurring thoughts of hanging myself or drowning myself but im too scared to do anything about it.&#x200b;i've started doing poorly in school, and i love what i study but i am weeks behind now and my gpa has plummeted. i haven't had a stable social life in nearly four years because i took two years off after i graduated high school to find my interests and now the two years that i am in university have been online and my country has been in lockdown for a majority of those two years. the only social life i have is going to a cafe with my friend once a week for a couple of hours, and im so grateful for her but i find it hard to express myself in this way with her. i write poetry and i love to draw, but i haven't drawn or written poetry n a month, whenever i try i end up stopping after a few minutes and choose to just sit and do nothing and just contemplate for hours like i usually do now. i used to write a lot, but my poems got rejected twice now and i feel like a failure. no matter how hard i try to write nobody appreciates them, they get unnoticed most of the time, and it makes me want to stop altogether.  i would love to go to therapy but i cannot afford it, its much too expensive here and my university does provide therapy but they have a 2 star rating. i know someone who went and they strongly disapproved of it, saying it made her issues worse. i cant afford therapy, so i've started writing a book about the taboos and sociological explanation for suicide. i like to say its a book but in reality its just a bunch of ramblings and deep thoughts i have about suicide and my feelings. its almost 100 pages right now, and i dont think i will stop. i write on and off, usually at night when im unable to sleep.&#x200b;i've lost nearly 30 pounds, which isnt good because i was already so thin before and now i look emaciated, i eat a multivitamin for breakfast and then just one meal later for dinner. i'm never hungry anymore, and if i even eat more than one meal a day i feel sick and feel like throwing up. when i go with my friend to the cafe once a week i only get black coffee while she gets delicious drinks and food because im scared of gaining weight. im scared ill be seen as ugly and unattractive if im not thin like i am now. i met a girl in the summer that i really liked and it was mutual between me and her but i cut it off soon after because i felt insecure and ugly. i lost my best friend in august because of a stupid mistake, i cut her off because of my own insecurities but that is how all my friendships and relationships end, i become toxic and manipulative and controlling to the point where they leave.&#x200b;in august 2016 i was raped by my ex-girlfriend, she demanded that i have sex with her and when i hesitated or refused she would dig her nails into my genitals until i said yes, and now i have scars from her. she would do this constantly, whenever i wanted to leave her or had to go home she would do this, and i feel ashamed for not doing anything about it then. i saw her on the train a couple of months ago, i was standing near the door to get off at my stop, and she came and stood next to me but thankfully i dont think she recognized me but i felt like collapsing. this girl and i broke up nearly 5 years ago, and every year she tries to get into contact with me. there has been someone harassing me on instagram for months now, and whenever i block the account a new one gets made to continue the harassment so i simply just ignore the texts i receive. i received death threats and comments telling me to commit suicide, as well as messages that contained private personal info. i lashed out at my friends and people i loved because i was scared of this, i cut people off for no reason thinking that the person harassing me was them, i lost my best friend at the time because i thought it was her, out of my own paranoia i lost everyone and accused people that weren't in my life anymore because it felt good to ""end things"", because i know that i can never stop this girl from tormenting me. nobody believes me, when i tell people i know of the things she did i have to lie about stuff she did to make it seem like it wasn't that bad.&#x200b;i dont feel appreciated, whenever i feel confident enough to talk about my interests, poetry, art, sociology, philosophy, soccer, i always feel belittled and stupid for opening my mouth and i have been told by people that they dont care or that what im saying is boring and it really really hurts. thats why im writing that ""book"" about my thoughts and ramblings, nobody else wants to hear me out or hear what im passionate about to the point where i feel like i should never open my mouth.&#x200b;theres a lot more on my head i think. but i think this is long enough so thank you to anyone who read this, and im sorry if it didnt make sense.. i dont think i want to die but suicide is all i can think about. it is

i’d have to uber more, and still work enough hours to keep health insurance (yeah yeah, i should have been going to school years ago and have all time available for working now) to continue school. i’d also have to get vaccinated to be allowed to go back (parents are really against it saying it’s part of a new world order, and i’m still concerned about side effects of it).i’m so alone, don’t see how my life can flip anytime soon. i don’t just do it, because i’m scared of possible hell, and just leaving permanently…….my family talking about how america, and not just america, but the whole world, will be under a “new world order and one world government” in just a few years, and that the “antichrist” will take over, and that it’s the literal biblical end of the world from the book of revelations.who knows if that’s true, i’m not sure. i lost faith in god over 10 years ago, ironically because i couldn’t get a girlfriend (i was 13 or 14) but i have a lot more reasons to doubt in god or existence of god now, and all those reasons aren’t even about me personally, but also the world at large.i remember when i got back from the psych facility, after 3 months, nobody even acknowledged that i was gone, i wasn’t even bullied about it. i imagined blowing my brain out and everyone cheering.today, 10 years later, at nearly 26 years old, at my pathetic job, i know that even there, even now, most of my coworkers would show concern and definitely acknowledge my absence (even know a job wouldn’t allow you back after being gone that long, even if you were hospitalized, i doubt the law would protect you from being terminated even then, at-will employment, yay)i’m not even real friends with everyone, but at least work friends?

facing third christmas completely alone,limosineeyelash,"i have severe contamination ocd. four years ago  my mental health was very manageable and i was in love with a partner i'd been with for five years, had just started university as a mature student, gotten set up with a psychiatrist who specialized in ocd and was about to move out with my boyfriend to a major city. my dad who has anger management issues and his own ocd lost his patience with me one night, because i had issues with objects being moved around the house and i wasn't getting well fast enough. he flipped out and kicked me out of the house. i was never able to go back and get my possessions. two weeks later i was raped by a friend of my boyfriends. the contamination phobia developed because i couldn't feel clean afterwards and my boyfriend wanted me to get a rape kit doene and wouldn't let me shower. my ocd got so bad i started washing with bleach cleaning products repeatedly, my boyfriend went back to live at his mother's but promised to get me into treatment. by this point my ocd was so bad i was unable to wear clothes in my apartment, was taking long decontamination showers with bleach creme cleaner that i had chemical burns all over me (i would pour more bleach into the burns and it hurt so much). my hair and nails were falling out and off and in order to accommodate all the rituals i required to be able to eat and wash myself was forcing me to be awake for 24+ everyday. my boyfriend never got me help. i wound up being forcibly confined in a mental institution when my mother heard through a cousin that i was ingesting bleach. i was confined against my will in a psyche ward for 6 days. it was necessary, but not the right intervention for me, i couldn't eat or drink anything there, i could only drink or eat certain items my boyfriend brought and cleaned first. i lost 11 pounds and developed a fear of hospitals. after i was released, my boyfriend abandoned me slowly. my ocd actually was improving, but he had new friends and was forming a new life. his family had money and they gave him a new apartment, a new car, and he just left all his stuff here with me. i existed in the graveyard of our relationship and i would desperately try to talk to him and he would keep avoiding me. eventually he disappeared completely after holding my face and telling me he still loved me and wasn't going anywhere and i was being silly for worrying about how much he kept disappearing. he ghosted me 7 days before my birthday (which is sadly the anniversary of the day i was assaulteed too) i was so worried about him. he was fine, he just didn't want to speak to me. after 10 days i finally saw on a mutual instagram friend's page that he was at a gathering at our local lakefront. i went down there and asked to speak with him. he agreed, but wouldn't look at me and was acting very weird. insisted that he just wanted space right now and that if i had wanted to contact him i should have contacted him another way. i asked how, considering he wasn't answering his phone or email and he just said, ""there are ways"". his friends had all left when i showed up and then he got on a bike and rode away.  two days later a police officer called me and i was charged with assault and stalking. it took forever to get the disclosure package. he claimed i had hit him two weeks prior to the time i came and found him. the case wound up getting thrown out after a years wait because of covid, but in the interim there was a no contact order and while my ocd was much improved, i was traumatized and confused. i still am.  from what i know he's dating another girl now, from that group. her ex boyfriend and i became friends and that friendship really improved my mental health, but he suffers from bpd and he painted me black after i admitted i was in love with him recently and it scared him.  this is a lot of crap to type and there's so much more messed up stuff happening in my life. i'm so isolated and alone and i feel scared to seek help because i'm scared of being locked up again.",3.0,0.0,1600372350.0,suicideWatch

"i am transgender, and i am losing hope.",illyreal,"hey all. i'm illy, i've been actively transitioning medically for just about 2 years now, my first dose of spiro and estrogen were on dec. 21st 2019. i've been struggling for months or years beyond with suicidal thoughts, and i am so concerned that i am getting closer to the edge.a bit about me, i have lived a pretty rough life. i grew up in a broken family, just like so many other kids, and one with a highly queerphobic father. he used to tell me stories about how proud he was growing up in the 60's beating up gay folk for being gay. we never had a lot of money for things that we wanted, we had a lot of things that he wanted, like the hockey gear that he bought so that he could make me be a goaltender, but when it came to pursuing my own interests it was always short on change. growing up was rough, we moved every few years so he could dodge his income taxes a bit longer. i never really set down roots or understood how to make a lasting friend.i didn't know i was trans for a really really long time. i was 26 (late 2016) when i first started questioning why i never felt like i looked right, and through various throwaways and therapy i came to my ultimate conclusion. by this point i had already gotten with the person i thought i was going to be with forever, and we had a lovely little family with two children that i was providing for. one hers, and one ours. revealing that i am who i am, and how i am, broke our family. within a year or so, our relationship fell apart, she split (late 2017, early 2018) and separated me from the eldest child who i had raised from birth with her, as he went to live with his other biological parent. i was left, alone, with my girl and my grief. when i think back, this is the moment i never seem to be able to get over. therapy helped stem the bleeding, but i've never really healed. how could i when i've lost a child? for a while i managed to keep it together and kept working my job, i was in a really well paying secure position with an aluminum smelter, but my anxiety at not being my authentic self drove me to leave both that position and my hometown in attempt to pursue my truth.the intervening years, barring my transition, have been hell. i left my hometown in april of 2019, and by the end of november of 2019 i was finding myself in a position where i wasn't going to be able to comfortably or even basically provide for my daughter. at that time my ex had moved on and moved together to the city we were living in with her new partner, and they were in a financial / life position that was going to be better for the wee one. i made the decision at that time to send my girl to live with her mother, so that i could get back on my feet and get my transition stuff started. i needed to live authentically. well. covid happened. i wasn't able to find work for approximately 18 months during the pandemic, stuff having been shut down as it was and leading into my inability to work positions similar to what i had worked up to at that point in my life, i was stuck. during this period of my life, being down without my children, without my love, starving and clinging desperately to the fact that ""at least i was medically transitioning"" has probably been the hardest of my life. i seriously contemplated my death a few times during this period, i even called the suicide hotline a couple times and i was left on hold. my best friend pulled me out of my rut during this period a few times just enough to dust me off and keep me moving, even just a little. during this period i have been also waiting on surgical assessments for my bottom surgery, since in canada (specifically bc) we have a lengthy waiting process in order to qualify for covered gender affirming surgeries.then, an opportunity. i got a call for a job offer in a new sector back in my home town, at a good rate of pay with lots of overtime opportunity. i finally felt like maybe the cards were turning around at this point. maybe, just maybe, i could get back home and put my hustle back on so i could prepare a place to have my girl home with me again. i finally got the paperwork and assessments put through so i could go for my surgery. i finally think, ""here we are, we did it, it's all coming together"".i just got the news that it's going to be several more months to years of waiting before i am likely to get in for my surgery. i found out that my income vs debt won't allow me to get any form of mortgage. rentals are far, far too expensive for any single income to afford here. i just faced down a brutal abuse by a guy i thought was going to be my partner, he led me on for months until we finally were intimate, just to turn around and say ""i want this to be a secret, i have a woman i am interested in making my wife and i don't want anything to mess that up."" i made an impulsive decision to order a bunch of computer parts for a much needed upgrade, and the delays on the shipping on them all have me so beyond hope they will ever actually show up that it feels like i just spent $1500 for nothing.i am drowning. i am suffocating. i am back in this small northern bc town away from my best friend in this world, i still don't have my daughter home, i don't know that i ever will, and i feel so hopeless. i no longer want to live. i don't want to die, i could never do that to my baby, but i do not want to live. i am constantly hounded by my ever present gender dysphoria. i need my surgery to help, i want to feel right, and nothing is working out. i have no family support. i am scared that i am going to finally break through that final line and just end it all. that thought terrifies me because i don't know how much more of this life i can take, before the thought of hurting my girl by hurting myself is no longer enough to keep me here. i need help, and it feels like nobody can help me.",11.0,6.0,1619644738.0,suicideWatch

partner walked in on me cutting today,sadguyhanginginthere,"been having really vivid nightmares from childhood lately after moving into a safe place for the first time in my life and have been struggling to cope with the new memories. starting emdr next week and just trying to survive until then. partner of 8 months has been so supportive of me and has seen the low of me many times, but i feel like today i went over the line.this morning i woke up after a bad dream, an hour before my alarm. i was just laying in bed alone before getting a call from my mom telling me to get the rest of my shit out of her house. started thought looping pretty bad and went to go pack a bowl to calm down. tipped it over with a toothpick by accident and spilled it onto the carpet.didn't even react like i normally do of getting angry or swearing or crying i just immediately pulled my pants down and went after my leg with a dirty blade that was on the end table next to me.i could hear my partner in a league game and thought he thought i was still asleep because he hadn't said anything the 20 mins i was out there. before i could clean up, i heard him coming down the hall and stood up and just froze.the first view he got of me this morning, after last night of me crying to sleep while he held me, was me standing half naked with blood running down me onto the floor and staring at him with an empty gaze.i can't even begin to say how much i wish this never happened. i feel like such an awful person for putting him through being with me for this long. he says i've helped him and that he's better with me than without, but i've repeatedly put traumatic images into his head by just trying to survive.he interprets a lot of it as his failure to protect and help me and then i feel even worse. i apologized to him after we calmed down and took a walk together and he said it was okay but i know it's not okay. i could see it in his eyes when he looked at me. i'm hurting this person left and right and i don't know how to stop. all he wants is for me to be okay and for us to be happy and i keep doing things like this to him as repayment for him loving me unconditionally.""you didn't do anything wrong""yes i did",8.0,2.0,1570760876.0,suicideWatch

just got out of depression and this shit hits me,Abizoman,"let’s strat from the beginning. my parents and my younger brother had a car crash 3 years ago now. my mother who was driving directed the car off a cliff and jumped out of it right before it fell. it was on purpose. my brother and father are gone. my older sister turned 18 a few days after   the crash and disappeared for good, she didn’t leave any trace and went somewhere, no one knows. what a fucking genius i have to say.i was now 14 alone with my assassin mom (she got away with it). i hated more than anything you could ever imagine. she tried to kill me but failed somehow. i almost never get in the car with her anymore. after a few months the anger went away and i fell into a deeeeeeeeep depression. stay in your room for 3 weeks type of shit. my way of manifesting my anger against the world was unfortunately to bully someone. this kid had just came out as gay and i got out of my fucking way everyday to make him feel like shit. i made him think i liked him and ended up getting nudes. i sent them to everyone. and a lot of other shit that i honestly don’t know how he handled so long. but he came to a point where he couldn’t handle it anymore and he killed himself in front of me. this was 9 months ago. no one ever blamed anything on me. everyone thinks that i’m the only reason he stayed for so long and that i helped him and was his friend. this made it so much more worse than it needed to be. i tried to go 1 month after because all of it was too much. i went on the highway and got hit by a car. i made it for fucks sake. and after 2 months of care and physical therapy i was back to 60% normal. after a lot of reflection it turns out i’m gay, like all the way gay, bullying that boy stemmed from my sexuality i think. doesn’t justify anything i did though. at this point i thought that my life was getting better, i was starting to forgive my mum, i was finding meaning in life with sports and so on and i was having a lot of sex. but then my mother found out 4 days ago that i’m gay. she immediately kicked me out the house. i have with me my phone, my passport, the equivalent of 200$, my guitar and some clothes. i’m 17, i’m not old enough to get a job in morocco and anyways homosexualty is illegal here. my plan was to go to spain when i turn 18 because that is the 25th of december. i have just about enough money to get there if i can survive in these streets until then. but of course covid fucks everything up and the authorities close the borders. i really don’t feel like trying to survive out here for how ever long it’s gonna take.so i thought about it, i’ve done enough bad to this world and i might even join the rest of my family if i end it right now. i just don’t want to mess it up again like last time, i need a plan .the only thing keeping me alive right now is a bit of hope for a better life if i can get to spain. i also have hope  to see or find my sister at some point.",13.0,2.0,1592439411.0,suicideWatch

it’s quiet uptown,jdola2,"i’m realising now as an adult that my life was fucked up from the moment i was born. never adequately developed as a child. i was never permitted to be me. i grew up in a house where i was considered the troubled child, the stubborn child, the disobedient child, the truant child. all because i was different. i wanted to play sports, i wanted to do different hairstyles, i wanted to explore what it meant to be your own person. i started a youtube channel, growing steadily with over 10k subs and i was told to focus on studies. i was a great footballer, on trials for chelsea and arsenal, but i was pulled out because they played matches on sunday. the day of the lord. suddenly i found out that my life being mine would never be the case. i was beaten as a child for the smallest of things. i don’t know how to express my feelings, i can’t look people in the eyes, i have social anxiety and i’m a mess. a cocktail of horrible emotions. i grew up in a home with a parent as a serial cheater. i witnessed domestic violence first hand. no here i am mid 20’s with a degree in law, and unemployed. no future prospects, over 400 rejection letters, fat and nothing going for me. i wonder where my life went wrong. but it’s clear to me that from the start, everything has been set up against me. i come from a upper middle class family and so i recognise the privilege i have to be in certain positions, but it’s almost as if everyone in my family benefited from this but not me. my brother is a lawyer set to inherit my fathers company, my mother is an author and a specialist in her field. my sister is on her way to becoming ‘something’ in the commercial field and i’m just here. struggling to get a job. you might wonder well what’s stopping me from sorting my life out? several things. in my vital years that i could’ve used to get apprenticeships, vacation schemes etc i was sitting up at night protecting one parent from the other, separating my parents from fighting, barely managing to hold my grades together. it’s a credit to myself that i managed to graduate let alone get the 2.1 i achieved. i never wanted to do law but with the way my life was set up, nothing was my choice. how can i with a degree in law be getting rejected from ikea, sainburys and warehouse operative roles. i understand that it can happen to anyone, but when you see your friends, family getting into positions that you know you’re capable of, it eventually makes you doubt yourself. looking back now and reflecting i’m wondering how could i have been so dumb to allow someone dictate what exactly i will do with my life. tell me where to sit, when to be home, tell me university isn’t for friends, stop me from going out, tell me family is everything. if i disagreed i would be reminded of how much money they paid for my schools fees, and how much investment has gone into my life. everything i wanted to do, i was shut down and told no. couldn’t go out to socialise, wasn’t allowed actually. now i’m at this point. realising my life has been controlled to the point where the only place i can get a job is in my fathers company. the pay is beyond mediocre, i have no experience in other companies, nothing to put on my cv besides my grades. for a long time i trusted in god and believed that he had a way for my life. that despite everything i was facing god will see me through. despite all things god would watch over me because i believe that he could. now i sit here in my car, playing it’s quiet outside, contemplating different ways to take my life. carbon monoxide poisoning ? hanging myself? i found a beautiful tree not too far from where i live. an amazing view. a perfect place to die. in a world where everyone around you keeps moving forward, and you’re in the same position you have been in for 3-5 years, it almost seems as though your life is finished. is there even a point in continuing in a life where it’s not yours ? far from what you imagined ? who knows, maybe i won’t take my life today, or tomorrow or next tomorrow. what i do know is i probably won’t make it to 30. i’ve tried everything. i really have.",1.0,2.0,1598811357.0,suicideWatch

aimless,Marealz18,"lately i've been feeling more and more lost and i think i've reached the apex. i'm going to tell you from the beginning of this timeline that makes me think the way i think today. i fell in love very early with this beautiful girl and we dated for 3 years until we broke up in december 2018. (im 20yo btw) i spent the year 2019 really badly and could only think about it. i went through really bad times but after an excellent reflection i realized that we only liked each other's exterior, we didn't have a real connection. with that i started to improve and by the middle of 2020 i was already fine and just thinking about the future, i would get into the college i wanted. i started flirting and venturing into romance once again. in june i met a girl who liked me, and i kind of wanted something so we started dating, but i didn't feel anything for her but i felt i could over time win and make more connection with her, and i was right, over time i started connecting with her. but everything went down when we went into different universities and over time, we were losing this connection. around december we broke up and i was aimless for a few weeks. however in 2021 i was even quite happy and celebrated a lot with my friends. in these parties i often met mariana who is here that begins to get complicated, i met many people at these parties but 2 people are extremely important, mariana and raquel who will come in the future. before moving forward, i want to leave here the situation, until now i had been with a girl who had extreme physical attraction but no emotional connection and with another girl who felt attracted to me but did not have time to create connection or even see if it existed. so i met mariana in may/june of this year and over time i was talking to her a lot, we always exchanged jokes, we have inside jokes, and overall she helped me go through a lot during the summer and i helped her too. during those months we created a giant connection which made me believe it was this time, although physically i wasn't attracted, the connection was there and i really thought she was the one.we started flirting but she never wanted anything and i almost ruined the huge friendship i have with her. i gave up the idea that i had to date her and her like me, with that in september / october i had been flirting with raquel, an extremely beautiful girl. and i was the one who thought only of mariana as a friend, told her about me gaining feelings for raquel. she made fun of me and one day at the disco kissed me and came home with me and all night she was asking if i preferred her or raquel and it messed with my head, in the following weeks i simply turned off my romance, told mariana that i just wanted to be friends and the feeling i had for raquel was on hold. i didn't want to think about romance and i didn't take the trouble to flirt. until last week raquel asked me out three days in a row. and i swear, no girl had ever made me feel that way, me and her in these three days we connected in a way that's hard to explain, something out of the ordinary and we were usually seen as boyfriends, always clinging to each other, even her friends commented. and it's been two weeks since we went out to a party and i drunk told her i liked her, and she told me to tell her this sober and that we needed to have a serious talk from what she told me, she took me from her close friends and doesn't answer me with any messages, i've tried to talk to her in person but always says no. i just wanted an explanation because we were doing so well and out of nowhere she stops talking to me. she was the only girl i connected with both physically and mentally and the fact that this was happening makes me very bad and not knowing what to do. i am completely lost, this whole issue of love and diseases that i did not even comment on because it was another giant text, makes me think that there is no point in continuing to live honestly the only thing that makes me not kill myself is my mom's still alive and she was going to have a huge heartbreak, so that's it. i'm completely aimless and waiting for the inevitable. first of all i apologize for my english, it's not my first language. second, i wrote this text in a way of venting and spending time, after this situation with raquel, i feel that love does not exist and i do not think anyone will take the trouble to read so far. but if you read it, then have a great day.",2.0,0.0,1574035028.0,suicideWatch

this is a rant post,spartan01268,"forgive me i’m black out wasted. i don’t plan on killing myself i just need to rant if you’ll let me.okay so to start things off i’ve tried to take my life twice already. i tried to slit my wrist and despite severing my radial artery twice (the “right way”) i survived. i’m left with this massive scar on my left wrist. doctors were amazed i survived both times. due to these incidents i lost my contract (commissioning into the marines) and therefore my dream job. i can’t even enlist into the marines now. i slit my wrist because i did something that i felt was completely my own fault despite the logical conclusion that it wasn’t and it was a spur of the moment reaction. because of the thing i did i lost my now ex girlfriend (she broke up with me) and she was the best i’ve ever had. i was so close to her family and everything. they viewed me as part of the family. i was practically living with them.i had everything going right for me. dream job lined up. dream girl in my arms every night. i finally felt good about myself and felt like i’ve belonged.all my life i’ve been trying to feel like i belong and i finally did. (that’s another long story) but now it’s all gone. i hate what i’ve done and i want to go back so badly and undo it all. i’d sell my soul, i’d give literally anything to undo what happened. i’ve been dealing with this for months and despite going to therapy and a treatment center after my second attempt, i just can’t shake the feeling that i’ve wasted my life and failed. i believe that i need to die. that i need to suffer. that’s the whole reason i chose to slit my wrist. to die painfully and slowly. i know people say “suicide is selfish”. to me, suicide is my punishment. i don’t want to die for the sake of not feeling pain anymore. i want to die because i believe i deserve to. that i don’t deserve the joys of life anymore because of what happened.thank you for reading this far if you have and please forgive my grammar because i’m black out drunk.",1.0,8.0,1502623281.0,suicideWatch

i didn't kill myself on the day i planned to and now i feel lost,Minaesan,"i didn't kill myself on the day i planned to which was on november 27. i've always thought i'd kill myself eventually and i planned to kill myself during fall break for so long. i want to die because the thought of having to work a 9-5 job and dealing with adult responsibilities terrifies me. i also have severe anxiety, social anxiety, and an inability to deal with discomfort or dysphoria. i don't want to work at all because that makes my life boring and meaningless. people would probably call me lazy and i probably am. i also don't have motivation or passion in anything so any profession is dull to me. i'm not even good at anything anyways. i'm not even good at making friends because of my social anxiety. i'm so pathetic and lonely. if i'm such a lazy waste of space who's a disappointment to my parents and only uses their money to buy drugs instead of trying to find a job, i should just die. i'll do everyone a favor. every time i come back home to my parents, i feel this massive amount of guilt because they think i'm working hard and getting good grades. they'd never suspect i'd do anything bad. they'd hate me so much if they knew how much of a drug-obsessed and incompetent person i've become. a person who can't even get out of bed to eat or bathe properly. a person who can't even order food properly without panicking. i'm not even having a good time in this world anyways so i don't want to have to deal with copious amounts of stress just to live and have a roof above my head.because i believed i'd die eventually, i destroyed my life by deciding to not focus on my studies, future career, ignore my responsibilities, and i also destroyed my body by abusing drugs. to me it didn't matter because i'd be dead anyways. the thought gave me comfort and allowed me to not worry about what i'd usually worry about. but as the day came closer, i started to get more scared. i really wanted to die but a part of me was too cowardly to go through it. another part of me knew i wouldn't go through with the decision, but i tried to lie to myself that i would be dead so that i'd feel comforted. i didn't know why i was suddenly reluctant. is it because my mental health got better after moving out of my house into a new apartment or is it because i have a romantic partner to live for? if my partner knew how sad of a human being i am, he'd be so disappointed. before i become a burden to him and mess up our relationship, i should die before it happens. i have so many reasons to die but so little reasons to live, and yet why can't i do it? the fact that i was regretting my decision frustrates me because i'm only making this harder on myself. i wish i had enough motivation and courage to go through with it because it'd be easier for me to. but now that i'm still alive, i have to deal with the consequences of me sabotaging my life as well as facing my responsibilities. i don't want to deal with this useless life anymore. but i'm too scared to die. i wish i didn't have reasons to live.i know if i told this to someone, they'd tell me something along the lines of get therapy, try medications, work out and exercise, journal, cry it out, or something like that. i don't have money for therapy, but i also think it won't help me because i don't want to try to get better. all i want is to die and i don't want to try anymore. i don't want reasons to live. and since i'm so dead set on not trying, i should die so i don't fuck up my life any further because i'm lazy and useless at everything. but i'm a stupid coward. i hate myself. if i'm not going to die, then all i want right now is to not be sober. i really hate being sober but i don't have any connections right now to get what i want because i'm too socially anxious/awkward and depressed to get out of bed. i'm not even that addicted to drugs. i don't even do them that much anymore. but that's because i don't have access to it 24/7. if i could get it any time i wanted, i'd take them so much more often. i wish i was high all the time.i don't know what to do anymore. being high all the time isn't a solution that'll solve all of my problems. but i wish it was. all i can think about is getting high right now. and someone to talk to. but all i do is rant about how depressed i am and never try to get better. but there's no choice but to try since i'm choosing to be alive anyways. i hate myself.",2.0,2.0,1595277570.0,suicideWatch

give me a reason to not die that i haven't already disregarded,gh057guy,"as an intro, i am an 18yo male from the southeast uk. i don't really know where to start from here but anyway, i have had issues with mental health for all my conscious existence. family mental health issues all around. my paternal grandfather killed himself before my father was born, fucked him up bad. he has a long history of poor mental health and he has told me personally that if i wasn't around [i wasn't planned, and my parents split up when i was 1] then he probably would've killed himself too. as you can imagine, my father wasn't in the best shoes to parent whilst being afflicted by serious mental health problems. fortunately my mother was an anchor for me and took good care of me in all but one regard. she denied the notion that i was different and needed specialist help, when in reality i was a detached and unhappy child, at the time i had no idea because that was all that was normal to me. i thought that everyone felt empty most of the time and that not enjoying basically anything was normal and this was just 'life'. this amounted up until i was 16ish and i started seeing a therapist to help deal with the storm in my head. she was nice, and made me feel comfortable  but that wasn't what i needed, i needed someone who made me stare my demons in the eyes and confront them. i gave up after about a year of increasingly stagnating progress. middway through my therapy i also started taking fluoxetine which is an ssri i was prescribed for my now formally diagnosed clinical depression. it helped a fair bit, i was much more functional but i knew that it wasn't natural, and so i stopped just a year after taking them, i regressed unsurprisingly and reverted into a barely manageable mental state that i am in currently. going back to my relationship with my father, he tried throughout and loved me and made me know that, but a lot of the stuff he did scarred me and is what makes up a sizeable amount of my depression. he was a drunk and a weed addict, clean now though fortunately for him. substance abuse paired with awful anger issues led to very uncomfortable experiences with him over the years, many of which i couldn't tell you about purely because i have buried them deep into my mind so that i do not dwell on them. this culminated with me being awkward in my own skin and not fitting in because i was weird and different, which made me the depressed shitbag i am today, aswell as years of bullying in secondary school (11-18) has pushed me to my limit. i was going to kill myself by hanging when i was 12 but i didn't go through with it because i was scared. now i am older, the urge has only grown as i become increasingly colder inside and my will to live wears ever thinner. i find myself asking what the fuck am i realistically fighting for, i am going to have this horrible nihilism with me forever, it's part of who i am and that's what i hate so much and is literally driving me to kill myself. the only thing that weighs on my conscience is the ramifications of following through. i have two brothers, one 21mo one 5mo, from my father's new partner, my parents and immediate family (grandmother, aunts, uncles, cousins, etc) who would be distraught if i killed myself. they all love me some much and thats what makes this hurt so much. i couldn't have a more supportive family yet i still feel so alone and empty. it's like some kind of sick joke. the ones that trouble me the most are my father and my mother. my father having a father that killed himself before he ever met him is a crushing reality, followed by your own son killing himself aswell. it would really hurt him, more than i could ever imagine because he already feels a lot of guilt for fucking me up. i just know he would rip himself apart about it until the day he died. and onto my mother. she would also be destroyed if i killed myself. her mother, my grandmother died of a heart attack not even two months ago as of writing this (04/12/21) so she is already extremely sad, now having no remaining parents. this would probably be enough of a reason to stop most people but in my fucked up horrible mind i have still planned to kill myself today, in around 20 hours from now, it is quarter past midnight gmt as i write this. i'm going to buy a litre of vodka and 5 grams worth of benadryl (diphenhydramine), the hope being that i never wake up again. i invite you to give me a reason to live other than the useless 'it gets better' or 'there's light at the end of the tunnel', 18 years has been a long time, and i don't want to do another 60 odd years of this shit.sorry for the bad formatting (i'm on mobile) and poor structure, i'm in a very bad place and i just needed a release.",1.0,0.0,1614902663.0,suicideWatch

it's starting to feel that way again,jesusandjudas,"i've been suicidal for about seven or eight years. much of that was sort of a bland lifeless trudging through school,work,and other parts of my life. i never had much emotion for all those years because it felt like all my energy was concentrated solely into keep going. i'm not going to vent about it right now but i had the sort of family situation where i had to be extremely guarded or i would exploited/seriously emotionally effected. very much so that everything about me would be thrown into my face and i was still faced the whole time.well thank god,about a year ago now i got to move into my partner and that whole still faced facade crashed down. like, crying for hours a day type thing. being a cunt because i felt like i was actually allowed to now. arguing back because i was allowed to now. it made me it very hard to control my emotions for my partners sake. i've never done anything seriously bad, mostly screaming crying breakdowns in arguments over porn,my laziness etc and stuff. it isn't their fault, but sometimes the way they treat me when i'm like that made me slowly regress back to being stiff lipped. like i really have to make it clear these breakdowns are bad. like,hitting my head off the wall,running outside in the cold night bad,screaming my throat raw bad, crying so hard noise stops coming out and my chest is so sore. i can't imagine how fucking hard it could be for someone to watch. but still it's my own way of working through my emotions genuinely and i feel like i've been pushed away. it's a lot. i've had to acknowledge my non-emotional state has made me such a fucking asshole. compulsive lying to people just trying to help me. years of feeling lonely because i felt that i had to survive, but i pushed all those people away. despite how awful and gut wrenching this past year had been, my emotions exist and they were true. but once again the stiffness has creeped back in. i want to self harm properly again. it's so much effort  on just...literally not ending it. i don't feel like non suicidal people understand what it's like to have the suggestion on your mind all the time. i'm reserving all this from my partner because i'm scared it'll all tumble out again. i have so much shit i need to work through and no access to therapy or anything. at least during my breakdowns i was sure of something- i wanted to live. i wanted not to feel like shit so badly i screamed my throat raw. for once my voice actually advocated for myself. but that's all gone now and i don't know what to do. i really don't want to put myself back in that place, but i feel like my relationship and myself probably won't survive if i keep going like this.&#x200b;just to establish i don't even really know what i'm posting this here even for,i just felt like it needed to be said and i don't know to who. i've never been diagnosed with anything. just someone say something.",1.0,0.0,1607739383.0,suicideWatch

my boyfriend’s depression,Different-Weekend384,"    i don’t know where exactly i should write about this. so, if this is the wrong place, please ignore/delete this.    so, i have a wonderful partner, that treats me with all the respect and gives me so much love, that i never thought i’d experience. but he had a very rough life up until now, had been suffering from depression for a decade and has been in therapy for a year or so.    i’m always there for him, to listen to him, help him the best way i can. to celebrate all of his small victories from all the help he’s getting and even when he accomplishes something on his videogames.    there isn’t a day where i don’t think about losing him, especially since he said that he wants me to keep going if something ends up happening. it’s a ldr, and he only feels well when he’s here, surrounded by people who genuinely care about him, far from his parents and the country he lives in. but, because of other circumstances, he can’t move to here.     the thought of losing him breaks my heart, because he’s my world, the love of my life.     since he may not be able to work due to depression and other circumstances, i’ve been seeing my options to sustain as both in the future, so he can stay at home working on his hobbies. i really want to be able to help him more, but i don’t know how. if you have any suggestions, please do let me know. my dms are also open to talk about this or if you need someone to talk to.",1.0,3.0,1602014198.0,suicideWatch

love and misanthropy,Beautiful_Hotel8246,"i would like to begin with saying i'm sorry. the thing that kept me from doing anything like this was the fear of hurting everyone. i couldn't bear the thought of all the pain i would be putting on everyone that's close to me.but it is honestly from a standpoint as an animal that it is a thought from which i keep suffering from. i cannot control if anyone hates me for the decisions i make. i am what i am. i feel what i feel and it seems i hurt more how often i thoughtabout these thoughts and how i would punish myself for it.i've been alone for a long time and as time goes on, as relationships come and go, as things happen in the world, i feel more and more detached. i'm aware it is merely the human body's limitations of perception, but i keep having to defend my energy and strive for things that aren't realistic.i am not a kid anymore to be shielded from the world nor am i trapped in illusions i used to sooth me as an adult. therefore, i unfortunately am not satisfied in the paradoxes of chasing ""success"" and ""romance"", the only things that kept me going.i realized i hated myself when i was younger because i developed narcissistic anti-social behaviors. i romanticized how handsome and loved i was (do to reassurance of my family). eventually my parents divorced and i moved around all my life not having any lifelong friends. i am now outgoing and social only when it proves beneficial to me. i would manipulate employers, girlfriends, even family members to ultimately achieve thegoal of trying to fill a void. now i try to stay to myself as much as i can to avoid hurting others because, though i understand i am the way i am, i am exhausted trying to be socially acceptable and i truly feel wrong morally when i do these things.i've always felt like i didn't belong and i used to absolutely hate the human race even when nothing (from a westerner's standpoint of morals) was being done wrong. just because others were happy and i wasn't.after having this self-awareness and studying great wars, conquerors, disasters, psychology, most of all strategy and how it can be implemented in all matters to achieve a certain outcome, i realized why i hated the human race.we are all hardwired to feel attached to the things we like. we will fight for the things we want if it is limited, and (without empathy and/or sympathy) will wish or commit awful acts to those who oppose us.we are quite literally hardwired instinctually to fight for what we want. warfare has developed so advanced that tactics are used to achieve an outcome that one desires without loss of casualty and resources through manipulation.everyone at least in first world countries is being manipulated every day.now (though the market fluctuates) there is an abundance of resources for our basic needs. still mankind is constantly at battle fully willing to step on others for power. i personally feel it is a combination of attachmentwith a fear of death and/or a fear of accepting that everything including yourself from a mortal standpoint is meaningless. to peruse things that pushed you to continue when there is no apparent reason, in my case being fueled by the desire for fame, fortune and lust of women.i strived for things and partook in activities that made me feel immortalized or at least feel such a depth of euphoria that one could be compared to feeling like god.this concept along with the deterioration of religion in modern day society is in my opinion the very reason why we are becoming more isolated as a people. why humans are constantly clashing to be the best.why we try so hard to be different from others through fashion and status. why i've noticed that people can no longer keep eye contact anymore unless it's to achieve something through manipulation of emotion. why people, especially those in power, have to make the choice of choosing who is inferior and unfit for what is believed to bethe spoils varied by the individuals and/or groups standards. we are no longer focused on just living in fact we are so detached from that. it has become ""nothing really matters and we're all going to die anyway so i'm going to make something matter. i will deem what is important and i will strive toward the outcome i feel is important no matter what.because (why not?)"" then from there is an act of will power and morals to see how far you will go to achieve this goal despite the constantly changing variables and the butterfly affect they have on the world. these monsters were born especially in the nations that support capitalism.these monsters have always disgusted the outside world that doesn't indulge including those who believe in communism. a way of life demonized to such a degree that china believes it should have more control over an inevitably dying earth. all of this is fueled by fear and temptation of the unknown. a truly unfortunate timeline to live in for the child filled with innocence or the artist who wants nothing more to create to feel joy. sinking in the quicksand of a society that runs on money and power racing toward the future fueled by whichever reason that is most supported by money and poweruntil inevitably, in this vast timeline and vast universe, a variable changes that shifts the paradigm.this started out as a suicide note to my friends and family but i believe i've fully explained and laid out my existential dread. i want to think this will help me somewhat quiet the few of many thoughts that constantly torture my psyche.it does feel good to get it out i will admit. i am a 24-year-old single guy living in a studio apartment with my cat.i love to play video games; make music and i unfortunately am absolutely smitten with lust. i am a fairly good-looking guy and do get flirted on when i engage with women. i enjoy being desired so i will lead multiple women on and play with their emotions for personal enjoyment.but i never go for the fling. i only have sex and date women who peruse me because of the fact that i won't feel bad going after women knowing i don't fit their ridiculous standards and it is more likely a woman will stay with me or have sex with me regularly if she is invested on her part. i have never asked a woman out on a date unless we were together, i have never asked a woman to form a relationship. they always asked me. that is why i've had about 3 long term relationships. one that lasted 4 years that completely shattered me due to my attachment issues and was quickly forgotten when i fornicated with a more attractive woman that i had absolutely obsessed with me.fortunately for a good portion of innocent people and unfortunately for the wolves who may be sociopaths, psychopaths or have anti-social disorders, the monster will surface sooner or later and we are eventually at least at an emotional standpoint, left to rot in our own minds.i don't know if i can ever go back to feeling comfortable in society, but i do feel i have a sense of morality. i fight with this often to achieve my personal goals, but for the most part at least for people care about i fight harder with the goal to not hurt them.if that was the old school reason why we continue as a race, ""to love unconditionally and to be kind to one another."" then it is my will to program myself to fulfill that goal. even if i must crash and burn in the process, die alone and/or of suicide.",1.0,0.0,1634688992.0,suicideWatch

im the worst person i know,xFEAR_NUGGETx,"two months ago i stopped going to work hoping that losing my job would be the last push i needed to kill myself.  unfortunately, i still haven't lost my job, nor have i gotten the courage to kill myself.  instead i am 20 yrs old, stewing in my mom's house making her life so much harder than it has to be.  i am just taking advantage of her. i am a tumor and i really don't deserve the life i've been given.  it's even worse because i have known how little value i have as a human being for a very long time. my dad made sure that i realized just how terrible i was at the ripe age of twelve. he made sure i knew that he hated me and wanted me to kill myself. i didn't even have to come to that conclusion on my own!!! he came out and told me at my neighbors wedding.  he told me to kill myself because i was sitting alone at a table with my head down during the party after the reception. when he saw me there alone he must have realized that i really must suck to be all alone at a wedding with so many kids my age.  so he grabbed me by the arm and dragged my out of the cafeteria to take me outside and start his verbal assault(not that i blame him now i get why he hates me so much).  at the time though, i was very confused because i didn't know how much i sucked at the time.  he started by disowning me, and making sure that i knew that a loser like me could never have been his son. he started saying thing's like ""i fucking hate you"", ""kill yourself"", and my favorite ""fuck you""(he always gave me the finger when he said that).  i unfortunately started crying and trying to hide at this point and i found my mom.  she was very drunk(my dad was too), but she kinda tried to help. she said that she was going to take me home but was too drunk so she went to find a friend. unfortunately she didn't think to bring me with her and left me alone with my dad. during this time he just verbally assaulted me, only more quietly because other people were starting to stare because i think they could tell that i was crying.  he essentially just kept telling me to kill myself for 10 minutes while my mom found a sober friend.  she came back with one of her friends that were their and she started her car and loaded me in the back of it with my mom in the passenger seat.  one thing i will never understand though, is how the fuck did they let my dad get in the backseat with me??? like really? so now that i was  thoroughly  terrified and embarrassed, i had to endure a 45 minute drive home with my father staring at me in the backseat, constantly mouthing the words ""kill yourself"" and ""fuck you"". thankfully that was the end of the night and i got to go think about how truly terrible i must be if my own father wanted me to kill  myself.   i'm truly worthless, in fact i'm worse than worthless.  at least with a worthless baseball card you can just throw it away, but as a worthless person who is too scared to leave this world without motivation, i am constantly draining my mom of her precious time and energy and she doesn't deserve it.  having written this and seeing my thoughts written here, i am still too much of a coward to take myself out of my wonderful mother's life. i am disgusted that such a kind woman could produce such a pathetic individual. pretty funny how the most effort i have put into life in the past 8 years is a pathetic reddit post rooting around for attention. really puts into perspective how much i suck.",10.0,6.0,1596834580.0,suicideWatch

how do i confront my friend in a way that wont scare her?,whtiektkentlaafn,"tl;dr: one of my closest friends is suicidal and me and my other friend are planning to ask her about it and i am asking for any advicei'm not sure if this is the right subreddit to ask, but idk where else to put this so please help me.for some background info, the person i'm talking about (let's call her abby) has been friends with me for years and we definately consider ourselves best friends.for the last 3 years, abby has been making jokes about suicide, at first i went along with it bc i myself was slightly suicidal and was making jokes about it too, however, i managed to pull myself out of that mindset around 2 years and a half ago. by that time, the suicide jokes had become pretty normal to me, so i didn't think too much about it when she kept joking about it, and for some reason  i didn't think she meant anything by them. it was at the end of 2019 that i began to suspect that maybe she is suicidal, but i quickly forgot about it because the suicide jokes had been decreasing and she seemed happier, so i thought she was getting better.by 2020, she seemed to have mostly stopped joking about it (although she joked about it occasionally), however, i began to noticed that she was mildly self harming. it wasn't very noticeable, it was things like sticking a needle in her skin, or scratching her skin with a needle, i didn't know how to approach the subject, so i left it alone and it seemed pretty mild and that she only did it occasionally. i wasn't too concerned about it and then corona happened and with everything that was going on, i quickly forgot about it. (for some background info, in the country that i live in we have only had two very short (like 3 weeks) lock down bc of corona however, things in our school changed and we had exams coming up and lots of assignments and the teachers bogged us down with work) 2021 comes and i've completely forgotten about it and she seemed to have gotten better and she didn't joke about it at all. we focused on getting through school and having fun and quickly the year ended and we finished exams and it was summer holidays. she began to mention how her parents are horrible to her and asking if she could come over to our houses. recently, it was one of my friends parties (let's call her yulia) and she is a very close friend of abby and me, and we noticed that she clearly cut herself on her forearm, she was trying to hide it, but it was a hot day and we were all in short sleeves so it was pretty obvious. this was alarming because, to my knowledge, she had never cut herself before, she had just scratched and picked, so i was concerned. i am a very non-confrontational person though so i just held her hand, turned her arm over, let her see that i noticed her cuts and lightly hugged her to let her know i'm here. she just hid the cuts and we didn't talk about it again.  after the party, i was one of the last ones getting picked up, so me and yulia talked about it between ourselves. she told me she thinks abby might be suicidal and i agreed with her. in the end, we decided to try and ask abby about it next week and try to get her to talk to someone because we are very concerned for her and what she might do. we were also thinking of talking to the school counselor about it (we all know him and a few of my other friends talk to him about their issues so we know that he can be trusted). i was wondering if anyone had any tips because i dont want to mess this up.",3.0,2.0,1638624868.0,suicideWatch

my cats are the only reason i'm still alive,fluffybuttsncats,"i mean, they are really so freaking cute, but it's pretty serious, i very much would like to end my life and would definitely do so if it wasn't for them. i joke about it because i don't know what else to do.  i've always joked in my head and to my cats that if it wasn't for them, i'd kill myself. lately, in the morning, in the first few minutes as i wake and am half groggy, the first thing that pops into my head is that i want to kill myself. and it usually is a pretty graphic thought, in the sense that i think of putting a gun into my mouth and i visualize the aftermath and do feel a sense of relief at the thought. the next part of the routine is taking care of my 6 cats, and that thought retreats into the background but i do consciously acknowledge that i would not leave them. i know that at least one or two would end up in a shelter or as a barn cat and that thought fills me with horror. especially because i work in an animal shelter setting and see people surrendering their cats for many reasons and experience the cat's confusion and pain first hand. i could never do that to them. there was an older cat at a shelter i used to work at that was there pretty much indefinitely, stuck in a tiny cage, because his owner killed himself and nobody wanted to adopt him.i sometimes regret having 6, only because i am responsible for their well-being and wish i wasn't so i could just end it. 4 out of the 6 are under a year old so shit, i've got  a long time with them still, hopefully. i say hopefully because at the same time, the thought of any of them getting sick or hurt terrifies me...i always joke with them that their backs must hurt since they constantly carry the heavy burden of my mental health well being on their cute fuzzy backs. obviously, i'm also pretty lonely since i joke with my cats...but that joke seems to make most two legged animals kinda uncomfy so i keep it to myself.. my cats are literally the only source of joy in my life, truly. they're the only thing that make genuinely laugh and smile, and i miss them so much when i'm away at work. when my cute fuzzy kitten that i bottle fed and cared for since she was a neonate comes and buzzes and is so happy to be with me that she literally drools...that makes me happy and i couldn't even imagine for a second leaving her. she would be devastated, i'm her favorite thing in the world, literally...she follows me everywhere and i catch her just staring at me sometimes with obvious love. but the very vivid morning suicide visualizations concern me. i live in the woods and have been encouraged to learn how to use a firearm in order to protect livestock and as protection from my abusive crazy ex, but so far have been able to put it off as i don't think it's a good idea for me to have access like that... but obviously i cannot tell anybody why i haven't learned yet.""nope sorry, today isn't a good day...this morning the same exact shotgun that you want me to learn to use so i can kill that pesky racoon that's trying to get into the coop and kill all the chickens indiscriminately was fodder for my suicidal ideation sooooooo...maybe next time?""(not that i want to kill the racoon, i love them, but they will completely wipe out a whole flock of chickens in minutes, it is unfortunate but sometimes it really i necessary, and that's out of a mouth of an animal rescuer) if someone told me that they feel the way i do, i would be very concerned for them and would tell them that they need to reach out to someone, to tell someone, that help is possible.  but i somehow would never follow my own advice...i know, in theory in a detached way, that i should get help, but i don't have anyone i could trust like that and deep down do not believe there is help. i've been considering taking antidepressants because this is the longest i've gone without a break from my depression..i used to get at least a month or two break from it several times a year, but not this year. but every time i start to feel a tiny bit better, or at least i tell myself that i do, i never go through with it.i should at least go to therapy, but am unable to even complete a task that simple nowadays, forever procrastinating.i am worried for myself though, in the sense that since the depression seems to be worsening, i will get to the point when even the cats won't matter. thank you for listening.",120.0,15.0,1621204610.0,suicideWatch

please help me… i am so lost,throwaway_syngonium,"i dont even know where to start all of this, now when i decided to write it all down my mind is completely blank, i am so sick of even existing. i am not suicidal nor do i plan to kill myself, i still have slight hope in myself that there is a reason for this happening and that me understanding why is just around the corner. that is what keeps me going, i guess. or i became so miserable that i have no energy to even kill myself. i dont even know. i know nothing. right now i am laying on the couch, 27, in a country of which i do not even know the language nor one living soul here. why? because my boyfriend made me prove his loyalty to him and i was ready to do absolutely anything to be like this for him, and of course, expecting the same in return. but i never got it in return. and i just want to know why? i have no family, my parents broke off contact with me 2 months ago when i wqs begging them for financial support just so i could have for my basic needs and wants and they did not want to help me. i grew up with a narcissist mother and very violent father, i have lived with my parents until 25 because at that point my mother manipulated me to the extent where i thought that this is all i deserve from life, being home, with my parents, every atom of me being controlled, not allowed to go out with certain friends because i was threatened that they gonna kick me out if i do. my father beat me physically until i was 17/18 to the point of such soreness that i could not walk for days at a time. but it was all i had, few times i tried to tell to my grandparents about it and i got kicked out from my parents house. my grandparents gave me a car - my parents sold it and took money for themselves, threatened me if i say anything to my grandparents that i will be kicked out. i did not hear “i love you” from them since i was 8. constantly making fun of me, of my weight, of how i look, of my hair on “unfeminine parts” of me, pimples, everything. i remember when i got my first period and i was so scared to tell it to my mother so i have stole her tampons, she noticed, forced me to strip naked in front of her and beat the shit out of me because i did not tell her that i got my first period. they used to lock me up in my room for hours everyday, go out and return home 30mins before my school started and let me out of my room to go get ready. i dont even remember 90% of my life because i forced myself to forgot. when i was 17 i got my first boyfriend, the first person that i liked and felt something for (just a highschool love, looking back now its funny) which with who i stayed for a year and a half, he cheated on me multiple times, called me in the middle of the night how he fucked some girl that lives 500km away from us because i did not want to fuck with him, and how it is my fault, how i am ugly and disgusting and that he had no choice but to cheat on me. foolish of me for even staying a milisecond with him, but i never had any self respect based on what i had with my parents my whole life, i thought once again i deserve this. friends always used me up for money (my grandma was giving me money for getting as at school) and it was my only way of keeping friends. they knew it, i knew it. fast forward to being 25. i have met such a wonderful guy online, it felt surreal, it felt like my patience and suffering has finally paid off and i got over it, i thought this was my reward for everything bad that ever happened. and what happened? i became obsessed with him, with his existence, with everything that he was saying that he was. he was all i ever wanted, at least presented himself as that. i was a virgin, he was a virgin too - which was very important to me, because i grew up in a household where my parents were first to each other and have spent their lives together, i was blamed to be a whore everytime i would hang out with my male colleagues from school or from neighborhood and i developed a fear of doing anything with man that i do not plan to spend my whole life with. and my ex cheating only intensified the importance of this to me. and i was so happy, finally someone who is the same as me on that topic. it took me 4 months to meet that man, i was terrified of any sort of rejection, i was terrified of my stretch marks, of my saggy boobs, of pimples - who looks like that at the age of 25? its a disgrace. i never in my life felt feminine or wanted. but he accepted me, we started dating, everything was going good until we moved in last year november. since then i have found out that he has, or had, i dont know what is true anymore, a serious porn addiction while talking with me, looking me in the eyes and for months telling me how disgusting and degrading it is, skipping every half naked scene of the movie because “he does not want to see that”, i told him many times without even knowing he has addiction that i would not mind if my boyfriend watched porn - and yet he still lied to me months and months and months on going about it. admitted that he was watching it at work and jerking off to it (spending all of his megabytes on the phone on it and because of that wasnt able to talk with me because no internet), how he watched it at home while i was in bed. we had sex everyday multiple times and did everything that was wanted and needed. today i found on his old phone a whole bookmarks category with folders called - new tier 1, tier 1, tier 2, tier 3 full of different pornstars, folder with skinny girls, folder with black girls (he claims that he is racist the whole relationship), step dad/dad/mom category and i just feel like i have been with an animal until now. he is just peacefully sleeping in our bed while i am crying holding onto my last straw in the living room asking myself why? why am i here again? since we moved here, he lied about his female coworkers, he was meeting her everyday, eating with her alone, meeting with her alone, keeping her as a secret away from me. he made me change my phone number - i did. he made me delete and block my years long friends from league of legends - i did. i moved into another country because of him where i do not know the language and because of corona finding a job was impossible. i am here stuck in a loop, i feel like i am in hell. i really do believe that i am in one. and i cannot anymore, i cannot for months anymore but it doesnt go away. he forced me to hate everyone so no one is a threat to him and to our relationship - and now after 2 years my brain is programmed to hate everyone. i cannot stand one living creature on this planet. i go out and i despise every woman that i see because i believe that my boyfriend would instantly cheat on me with her if he could. i caught him shamelessly staring at other women in front of me so many times… i feel threatened by his every talk with a woman, coworker, retail workers, post, anyone. everyone is a threat to me and i hate everyone that makes me smile and laugh and give him something that apparently i cannot give to him. yes i know that i am mentally ill, but it was a result of all the events that happened to me through my life. i feel like i am going insane, i avoid people as much as i can, i try my best not to say a word to anyone, i avoid even sitting next to a male in a tram/bus. all i ever wanted was to be all to someone, to be enough and to be worth of everything. yes i do know that i have nothing to offer because my will for life has died long time ago, but dont i deserve to be free and released from all of this? i hate myself, i hate every atom of my living body. i am bad at so many things and i get discouraged by every small inconvenience. i cannot anymore… i really cannot… there is so much more to this and if anyone wants to talk with me in depth or help me - please, please help me. i am at the point where i have to beg this from strangers on reddit. i didnt know where and to who else i could turn to. there is much more to what my boyfriend did to me but right now my mind is too scrambled to even think straight. i will write it later or explain it to people if anyone gives me a chance. i just cannot leave him, i have nowhere to go - my parents dont want me and i dont know anyone else. i have 200 euros on my bank account and i own barely anything. i live in austria and i do not know german and have been struggling with finding a job - i had few opportunities and 3 of them wanted for me to have sex with them in order to get a job, because i guess mens mindset is that i was already miserable enough to do that just for the sake of the job. then new lockdown, then more of the bullshit, it is impossible to find a job. i genuinely do not see a way out of this. what am i supposed to do? i cry and cry and cry, and cry more, i am surrounded by mess, uncleaned dishes, onvacuumed floor with barely any food left in the fridge. i have no energy or will to exist. why would i even? how do i get out of this? please someone help me, i am lost and i am scared to live like this my whole life, i can barely get through the day anymore. someone please help me, be it mentally, through talking, financially, any type of way, please…  there is much more to this than i wrote, i am just in so much pain and i dont see myself being able to survive one more day, my heart sinks so deep in my body and hurts so bad, i tried to convince myself that i can at least love myself but how can i if no one ever even tried to love me?

"does it matter, or does it not? idk",Incu-geo,"this is big i am sorry. i have been for quite a while here just reading and reading everybody's else posts because i am not good at expessing myself. also depression makes it really hard to so. you don't feel like sitting and writing about how shitty your life is when you don't want to do anything at all. oh well, here i am i guess. even now i am feeling like it's pointless what i am doing. i am gonna regret it later probably but whatever. there are so many things i wanna talk about even though i have already told my therapist about them all. at first i was feeling like getting everything out of me was gonna help and it kinda did. sure it's reassuring when you weren't talking about your mental health to anyone for years, keeping everything to yourself because you were afraid and lonely and suddenly after so much fear and anxiety you express yourself to someone. just them hearing you out is enough for you at first. but as i just said 'at first'. after you are done with getting everything off your chest you want to see something improving in your life, don't you? that was a lot of work for a depressed person, no? you deserve something, right? oh well, you are probably going to be the only one congratulating yourself, if you even do so. it just keeps on going that way. your problems stay there, you are trying to look at things a little more positively, you maybe get a burst of serotonin out of nowhere as a coping mechanism from your brain in order to not blow it out but that's just not enough. i don't wanna be living like a parasite my whole life. i want to be able to do things. how can you do anything though when the little things you do don't even matter? oh you got out of your bed? you brushed your teeth? you managed to eat? you went out? you washed your dishes? you took a bath? you went to university? congratulations nothing of these matter to society and nobody cares. only you care. how's your life gonna become better if you are malfunctioning as a human being? how am i supposed to talk to people and make friends when i have anxiety and become awkward as fuck? not even gonna talk about the romantic relationships because oh boy isn't it a black hole. and even if you manage to talk to people and make some 'friends', you will start questioning if everything is real, if they do even like you, if they pretending and as always you mess things up. how's a person gonna stay with you and like you when you are boring and weird? my life has been a mess, and your's maybe even worse. i don't do drugs, i don't smoke, i don't drink and what do i get? becoming even more miserable? thanks. depression became my addiction. after some time you get so used to it you can't get out, you can't feel happy and you don't feel like you want to. if something good happens you don't know how to react. you don't know what to do. you ain't used to this so your brain starts thinking negatively again. that's what it knows, that's what it has been doing all this time. overthinking and overthinking gets you nowhere. i am tiring myself out. my therapist is tired of me too. probably because i keep on being up and down all the time. probably because i am lame and repetitive. even when nothing bad happens i will find something to feel sad about. my miserable existence maybe. but it doesn't matter because if something even happened i forget anyways. my brain is tired. whenever something bad happens i just remember that something happened and not what it was. it got used to it? it's self defense? i don't know. one thing i know is that i can't control myself anymore. i became numb. i am just living for the shake of living. i hate myself and i cannot change that fact alone. i am not strong enough. i need someone to be telling me the opposite of what my mind is thinking all the time but that ain't possible. how can someone love you when you are like that, so fucked up inside? does love even exist? i don't  know. i don't fucking know and to tell you the truth i don't think i will ever experience it. i am so tired and the only answer to all my questions above is ""i don't know"" because that's the only thing i know.",3.0,0.0,1577055724.0,suicideWatch

i don't want people to talk about my death,andi0000p,"in the past i would imagine the things people would say when i finally do it. i've been suicidal as long as i've had cognitive memory (around 6 years old). it's always been a matter of when, not if. whenever someone kills themselves there's always a social media frenzy where every person they've known is suddenly devastated by this loss that literally does not impact them. everyone has a sob story about how they should have been a better friend, done more, reached out when they were clearly struggling, etc. they make these huge posts essentially high jacking the tragedy for self pity and clout. then all the virtue signaling falls to the wayside as grief settles. it never changes behavior and all the things they promised to do moving forward are abandoned. it's no ones job to save you but it really bothers me how much people use these circumstances to feel bad about themselves. especially when they would never have even noticed the deceased is gone had there not been an announcement.i'm at the end of my rope. i'm so tired and weary and the choice i always knew i was going to make is getting closer. before i go i'm going to delete all my socials. my dying wish is that no one posts about it online. there's a select few people who this will genuinely impact. they will need support but i deeply hope they seek it privately. otherwise i don't want it announced. if people notice i'm gone and ask, i've instructed the people closest to me to give them the facts and nothing more. maybe that makes me selfish. ultimately i'll be dead so what happens after that point isn't up to me. i just really prefer it this way and hope it's honored.when i choose to leave it's because i want to be gone. i mean that in the truest form. i don't want to be a conversation piece for mild acquaintances. i want to rest in peace",10.0,1.0,1602278191.0,suicideWatch

going to hang myself,PonyAezis,"my biggest regret in life, is not killing myself sooner. i’m 25 years old, no friends, no family, never been in a relationship. i have no shame in killing myself as no one will miss me. i have no obligations towards another person. no one will miss me, no one will remember me after a week. i do nothing but work, and read. my job is fine, but i live in the us. i read for a few hours a day, psychology and philosophy. mostly antiquity philosophy, but i bounce around a lot (currently reading camus and  machiavelli). i’m not depressed, i take care of myself. i cook everything i eat, my apartment is pristine, i exercise, i have good hygiene, 8 hours of sleep a day, i don’t own social media besides this reddit account i rarely use. i have a healthy lifestyle, i’m a minimalist, i only buy groceries and books. i never eat fast food, drink, or take drugs. i have a healthy, disciplined lifestyle. there is very little i could do to improve my life, yet i cannot do anything to rid myself of this longing for non existence. i have the intelligence of a refrigerator, despite myself focusing on philosophy as a future. i know there isn’t much of a future in philosophy, but it is what i am interested in. i have no care for money, rather i despise it. i make more than i care to spend, because there isn’t anything worth buying.i’ve held on for long enough, and my mental state in the past decade has declined rapidly. i’ve been in therapy for 8 years, a myriad of different therapists, yet it hasn’t helped. no one will miss me, no one will remember me, i am not a person worth either consideration and thus i feel no sympathy for any negative impact my death will cause unto others, because it will have none. so i’m going to hang myself, despite having a content life, and a bright future. maybe i would’ve been such a great student i end up in an ivy league graduate school, maybe i end up writing an extremely successful book one day, immortalizing myself till the end of humanity. at what cost? removing myself from myself only to live for uncertain positive contributions i may one day bestow among all? is it enough for me to feel fulfilled by making such a historically relevant contribution, that i would not regret continuing on? perhaps i want to hang myself because there is nothing to fight for. our brains cannot be satisfied without problems to solve, so we create our own problems in our head to solve. finland has the happiest people and the highest suicide rate, i would attribute it to this same issue. an easy life, with no inherent meaning, and the meaning i’ve conjured up for myself, cannot suffice well enough to endure the suffering that comes included. there is no excitement, there is no uncertainty, there is no mutual understanding. i understand enough to understand my problems, but not enough to understand why i should continue.i will never be in a meaningful relationship, not because i am an incel. but i refuse to act untrue to myself, and present a character for romantic validation. i am a boring person who people aren’t interested in, because i am not interested in others, only what ideas and motivations they have. i like the person i am, but i will not change my personality to such an extent that i would act dishonest to myself just to entertain and charm another at the expense of the self. i wouldn’t be anyone else, i am who i am, comfortable and content.i don’t believe in free will, but i believe in self determination. i could be very successful one day perhaps, is it worth it though? if i could see where and how i am today, i would’ve killed myself many years ago; and quite frankly, i’m tired of repeating this every few years. i am prepared both physically, and mentally to die. my only regret is that i didn’t try as hard as i could’ve. i could read and write more than i do, but i am shit at both. one day i could master them, but that isn’t enough to keep myself around.i’ve tried my best, it’s enough, i’m burnt out of life, my future, and tomorrow. goodbye",5.0,2.0,1374091033.0,suicideWatch
my dad hanged himself,Independent-Result54,sorry for my english im an 17 year old european im trying... this might be a long post but i would like advice from you guys or people with experience and i need to get this off my chest since i dont have alot of people i can really talk to because im lost.. about half a year ago my father found a new wife since my parents were divorced. at that time before he married he would ask me would u still talk to me if i found a new wife? at first i was like nah are u out of your mind u aint marrying. but later i was like aslong as its a good wife and makes you happy but i dont wanna get to know her. so he married her and since he married her he didnt spend asmuch time with me he didnt call me asmuch he used to help me with my books and shit financially before i started working he stopped doing all this. his wife didnt want him spending time.and shit with me. at that time i was angry at him so i stopped talking with him for  awhile and he said he would make a new kid with her a kid that would listen to him i was like whatever but this wasnt the first time we stopped talking to each other. we always beef then we make it good again. so we made it good again but about 3 weeks ago i stopped talking to him well i talked to him but i didnt answer his calls asmuch i didnt spend asmuch time with him as i used to not like i spend time with him alot before but less... either way i told him to not call me because he only comes to me or calls.me if he feels like it. i was just angry just because he calls me or comes to me once a week or once in the 2 weeks if he wants to. what kind of dad chooses his wife over his son and whenever you beef with your wife you get back to your son. anyway thats how i felt maybe it wasnt like that maybe he had his own problems clearly. 1 week passed away i was working at a late saturday my father came to my work randomly i wasnt expecting him.. he asked my colleagues if i was working and they said yeah he told them if they could bring me to him that he needed to talk to me privately. so my colleagues come to me tell me my dad is here i go to my dad and i tell him im working this isnt the time to talk right now and he smiles at me and is like alright ill wait for you outside tell me when you finished. so he goes outside i finish my work he waits about an hour for me and when i finished my work i straight up took my bike and ride away with it towards my house. he went after me with his car and honked a couple times to me but i ignored him then he called me and was like we need to talk we cant be like this but i told him to go home and leave me alone. on my way home i saw my 2 cousins i went with them to buy some shit at the supermarket and i think my dad saw me too and he went home dissapointed. the next sunday he calls me about 10 or 15 times i dont answer. the next day.... monday i was working out from 14:00 till like 16:00 he calls me alot again like usual but around 14:30 he messaged me son take good care of ur family and sister be a father i love you but i didnt read it at first else i wouldve called him instantly or go to his house... when i finished working out i went home and my cousin called me. she never calls in 17 years this was the first time i was like what the.... so i call her im like wassup... she tells me to call my other cousin its something about your father... so i was scared i thought it was something with his lungs or heart since he smokes alot of cigarettes so i call the other cousin (her brother) but before i called him i read those messages and i already had some feelings so i call him and he tells me if i am alone im like yeah why whats wrong he tells me to sit and get a glass of water at that moment i knew... then he told me ur father died he hanged himself i didnt believe it why the fuck would he do that i thought he was kidding i thought it was a plan my dad made up so i would talk with him again. but it wasnt... so after i heard that i instantly called my mom and sister i told them to come home instantly it was important i didnt tell them on phone i was scared something would happen while driving home... so they come home i tell them what happened they didnt believe it either but it was true. later that day we went to his house. whenever someone commits suicide detectives have to research if the suicide was out of the persons own will or if the suicide was forced by somebody or whatever. so they didnt let us in and my father lived in like a flat where u have 1 small door at the bottom and if that door is open u could go up to his room. but the detectives didnt let us in they said we had to wait for the research to be done but i was i was stresses and wanted to see my dad so i broke that door and i went upstairs to see my dad but the officer took me outside handcuffed me for 10 mins and cooled me down and let me go so we waited outside for the research to be done. and we saw a few neighbours walk by while we were crying they knew someone comit suicide because of the police and detectives. so this one old woman came to us and told us that she was my dads neighbour. she told us my father was a good man always happy but he always beefed with his wife everyday. she said his wife was never good to him and the day before todat (sunday) his wife hit him outside while they were argueing apparently they always beefed but the neighbour said my dad never layed a finger on her. that my dad is a good man but the wife killed him and it wasnt just her 2 or 3 neighbours said the same thing. so about an hour passed away i went outside to get some fresh air but while i was outside my dads new wife came in. i wasnt in there but my mom and sister were still waiting for the detectives to come. so his new wife came in and was straight up talking shit. she was like how did this happen... omg... my mom was like yeah we should ask you that question since you live with him. she was like yeah when his son and daughter dont answer the phone he would go mad.. so she tried to blame me and my sister from what i heard. i come in and i wait with my dad and sister i see her looking nasty at me im like the fuck you looking at she is like nothing. so my sister tells me the story about how she is blaming me and my sister. i told her what the neighbours told us and told her if she would talk wack one more time about my sister i would kill her she got all red and apologized either way fuck that bitch. so we waited about 2 hours and they came downstairs told us that my father hanged himself out of own will and it wasnt forced suicide. they told us if we wanted to we could go inside and see the body. so we went inside they told us he was in the right room. i go in the room first i see my dads body laying there in the bed his eyes closed i see the strains around his neck from the rope his body was so cold i couldnt believe it i kissed him i didnt wanna let him go but my mom pulled me away then i his wife came in you could litteraly see her fake crying it was so obvious... fuck man so we wait for the people to pick the body up and bring him to the mosque since in our culture you gotta wash the body and in 3 days he gotta be burried. so while we wait my cousin comes in brings me my dads stuff as memorial. hes a good guy honestly he is the only guy that has ever been there for my father when he needed him and to be honest he been there more for my father then myself probably. so while we wait i ask my cousin what happened the told me my father was fine he didnt seem depressed or stresses at all in the morning he told him to give this.money to me since i didnt talk to my father he gave him a rack for my driver lessons since he wanted to help me. so my cousin was like alright will do so my dad and his new wife beefed again at work that day thats why he was home so early. so he messages me with i love u take good care and messages his new wife and his sister so my dads sister read it at first and got scared and called my cousin (her son) to take a look at his house to see wassup. so my cousin tells me he went to his house but nobody opened so he called and messaged him he didnt answer so he calls the neighbours and tells them he is afraid something happened and asked of they could.open their door so he could climb trough their balcony to my dads house. so he did that and when he opened the door he saw my dad on the wall... he saw the body and the rope and fainted at first. he called the police after that then he called me and thats how it happened.  yeah so he told.me what happened and we waited for them to pick the body up. and while we were waiting his new wife started talking about money and said they always put money on this table that someone stole it. like we give a fuck about money.... like what... my father dies and she thinks about money... i mean its obvious she never loved him she litteraly only.married him so she could have an european passport since she lived on turkey... struggled there and met my father and used his money... either way fuck her so they took the body next day we washed him he went to turkey and we burried him there. thats pretty much what happened.i feel bad i blame myself for him comitting suicide. if i knew he would have had this much stress and depression because of his wife or life i wouldve even lived with him but i didnt know i ran away from him i avoided him like an idiot child... everyday i live with regret and it doesnt go away whenever i think its getting better i think about it again. he would always tell me to go therapy he would always tell me that he is my father he would never want anything bad happen to me he would want the best for me. i didnt take him serious. sadest thing is he never went to therapy himself while he told me to go.i shouldve went to therapy together with him if i only knew damn man fuck me... but on the other side this isnt the first time that i beefed with him and didnt answer his calls my brother also passed away 3 years ago because of an mental ilness and my dad kept going in life he marries 6.months with some random and this happens... my father and mother were married 30 years and beefed every week and nothin happened i dont know why he would do this all i know is i havent been there enough for him. whenever he would tell me to come to his house to hangout or outside to a bar to chill or whatever id always say no no no id chill with my own fake ass friends smoking weed and beeing a junky instead of chilling with the actual guy that need help and

.,Different-Contest-65,"i'm just tired of everything. there is nothing i look forward to, nothing that makes me happy. i make everyone around me miserable too. i'm just a failure and fuck up, an angry miserable bitch. and i have nothing in me to be better. i can't do anything right. i've wanted to kill myself for years and i think it's near time to do it. i wanted to wait until my parents had passed to do it, but i really don't want to wait much longer. every day feels so hard. people who want to die should be allowed to. i've just been wasting space and oxygen and i am not going to get better. i don't think i ever will or am even capable of doing so. some of us are just not meant to make it, some of us will die without the happy ever ending we crave. i'm so tired. i used to feel afraid of doing it but that fear doesn't exist anymore. all that stops me are my pets and family. for nowidk. i just want it to end. why do we have to be here living for the sake of other people, people who don't want you around when you're alive. just tired",2.0,1.0,1638573075.0,suicideWatch

the lows are always so low,cruciblesoul,"i just got back from the ledge. i always know my thoughts are just that and not always truth.. but it’s the depression ever so convincing. i’m 39 years old and iv sufferer with chronic depression, anxiety, ptsd, and some major suicidal ideations since 1996. iv been on almost any medication you can think of but i’m what they now call or consider a non responsive patient to them. iv been in more hospitals then i’d like to admit.. a few rtf’s (residential treatment facilitie) and have acquired some coping skills that have been helpful in life.. did actually find a medication that truly helps with my anxiety and keeping my demons away could of potentially killed as well so needless to say doctor wasn’t letting that happen. the medication was originally being used for lowering blood pressure but when you already have low blood pressure to begin with there is only so much a person can do there. so that sucked and made my life even more of a haha fuck you in this life joke. anyway if i can make anyones night less dark let me know",1.0,0.0,1620924941.0,suicideWatch
i don't think i can do this anymore,justdead_,"i am on my meds. i'm in therapy. i have a job and i do things and i am not isolated from the world or anything of the sort.but everything just makes me tired now. seriously, even the things i used to enjoy, like cooking or hanging out with friends at a bar, seem like chores now. there is absolutely nothing that i do that doesn't make me want to sleep for the whole day afterwards. i have been falling asleep around 6 pm everyday and just not doing anything else other than work. weekends have become just one big, long nap. sleeping is the only thing that helps and there isn't a single day that goes by that i don't think about how much better it'd be to just not exist.",4.0,0.0,1617884531.0,suicideWatch
all i want is things to become like they used to be...,Muepi,"long story: there's a girl i really like. she had been a friend of mine for a very long time. she was single for two years at this point. we met very often and had a great time together. about half a year ago, she told me that she didn't have emotions for me and that we should stop seeing each other. a month later she had a boyfriend. we still don't talk to each other. it's not because i wouldn't want to, it's because i don't know what to tell her. she was one of the most important people in my life, she was always with me and now we are forced to see each other daily and can't even look each other in the eyes. my life seems pretty pointless without her. i've already tried to kill myself once and planned it a second time. we wanted to be dance partners at the prom when we were going to graduate this year. when she rejected this and i found out that she now had a boyfriend i assumed she would dance there with him which i wouldn't have been able to watch. my plan was to have a car accident on the way there. since then i can't get rid of all these destructive thoughts. it just hurts to exist, especially when she is around. i don't think that i still have emotions for her but i can't live without her. i never learned to take farewell from a person that means so much to me. i still love her, even more than my own life but not anymore in a romantic way. it just destroys me to be around her and not being able to talk to her. it's like if a war was going on inside of myself and i keep loosing it every day again. i've had the best time in my life with this girl but way before i felt something for her and i have already tried seeing other people but there's nobody out there that can make me as happy as she did. i've also tried seeing a therapist but it didn't help. i don't know what i'm looking for. i don't know if i need advice, someone to talk to or just her...",2.0,3.0,1577916377.0,suicideWatch
i hate my friends and the loneliness makes me want to kill myself at times.,horniguy123,"i hate my friends. i cannot stand them anymore. they are bunch of condescending lowlifes who always try to bring each other down. i like some of them. some are nice but the others are not. i am in a friend circle, and why is it that always i am the dumbass. i am the guy who is supposed to be clowned on. my bad, they clown on others too. i go through suicidal thoughts almost every now and then because everyone intimidates me, makes me feel alone. i have no support system at all. at times like this i feel like i want to cry but i cannot. i was bullied as a child too and i think i have stockholm syndrome kind of a scenario, where i always get attracted to those groups that will bully me.i often blame myself, saying why dont i have a thick skin like them or others or why i take shit like it seriously but it hurts when they make me feel less than human at times. i dont belong here. sometimes i feel like i dont belong in this world. no one cares about me, no one even knows i exist.and when i vent like this often i feel like i am the bad guy for venting and hate myself even more because i am not ""strong"" enough compared to others. i am going to therapy and i have identified my issues but where do i go from here? i literally have no one to be vulnerable to other than my therapist once a week.",3.0,2.0,1634205582.0,suicideWatch
