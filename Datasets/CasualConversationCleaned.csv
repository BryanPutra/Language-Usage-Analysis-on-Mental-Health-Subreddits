i stabbed myself in the ass as a kid,psylikik,"it was summertime and i was 11 or 12 when i was playing with a swiss army knife in my room. i recently got the splinter cell game for the 3ds so i was practicing some knife attacks which consisted of some uppercuts. i was very aware of what could happen if something went wrong but nonetheless i kept at it and ended up stabbing myself pretty hard square in my right ass cheek. i was being babysit by my older cousin and when he heard me run to the kitchen to get the first aid kit he asked me you ok? i said yeah i’m fine while sitting on the chair with the blood leaking onto my pants. i didn’t admit that i stabbed myself since i was so scared of how much more trouble i would get into. i just got some gauzes and sat on them till the bleeding stopped.now that i am taking anatomy classes in college, i look back and realize i could’ve offed myself at 12 by hitting a fucking huge artery if the stab was a few inches off or a bit deeper. there’s a little bump in that area of my ass and to this day the only person i’ve told was my little bro so i thought hey i’ll share with reddit. god i’m so lucky.",751.0,57.0,1555029209.0,CasualConversation

boyfriend #2’d at my place for the first time and i thought it was hilarious,jnptot,"maybe i’m childish for this, but i thought it was so funny. we had just got back from eating. i’m about to unlock the door and he stops and i ask what’s wrong. he said his stomach was feeling weird and he didn’t know what was about to happen. so we go in and he goes straight for the bathroom saying, “i hope you still like me after this.” he was in there quite a while. comes out without saying anything and just looking at me. now, i had to pee to begin with so i’m going right in after him. i asked him if i need to take caution and/or light some matches. he just looks at me all serious and says, “i’m sorry”. now i’m not going to lie. it was rank. lit two matches. i come out just smiling and sit beside him on the couch. he has his feet tucked in and turned to the side away from me like he’s pouting. (he wasn’t, just looked like it in his position. he was just embarrassed.) i don’t say anything for a bit, just giggling a little to myself because of the whole situation. he finally faces my way and catches my eye and i’m still smiling. i say, “are you okay now? you done pouting?” he replies, “man, i wasn’t. just embarrassing. are you okay?” i say, “i’m fine, but is your *butthole* okay?” and start laughing. he starts laughing and mumbling something about me being crazy and it being embarrassing and all. dude is a teddy bear looking man and feeling all sheepish. but, i do end up telling him it’s okay and nothing to be embarrassed about because we all do it and maybe he’ll smell me one day. just thought the whole scenario was funny. how do y’all reacting pooping around someone new for the first time?",5229.0,349.0,1611491839.0,CasualConversation

the secret to being a good liar,grapejelly6,so i’ve lied a-lot this is actually coming from someone who used to be a compulsive liarand here is my secret to be good at it. first off you need everyone to think that you are a terrible liar so that they aren’t even onto you when you are actually trying to keep a secret.so create i fake tell. and give away a few small things that you don’t care about. my fake tell is that i can’t stop smiling when i’m lying which isn’t actually true but i’ve done it enough with small secrets that i don’t care about to where people think i’m a terrible liar.so now when i’m actually lying i won’t be smiling just will seem normal if someone calls you a bad liar you will know that you have succeeded and also lies build up so remember the more lies you tell the more you will have to tell to cover it up and more lies you will have to remember. these days i don’t lie nearly as much because i have much less to lie about. but it’s a good thing to be good at it if you don’t want someone knowing something.,2.0,3.0,1563096460.0,CasualConversation

thinking about making a major career change at the age of 25,Positron505,"so a little context for the 5 people who will read this, i am pursuing my masters in fundamental particle physics in a foreign country and i really love this major hence why i chose it. but i was having lunch with a colleague a few days ago and he pointed out that being a scientist or even getting my phd and becoming a professor isn't all that rewarding which kinda demotivated me. and tbh i was having a very rough semester with the masters program seemingly demotivating as well for me and idk why. but i started to look up other opportunities that might be better for me and have been considering making a change even at the age of 25 cuz i have a feeling that this might be for the better in the long term for me in many ways.i didn't tell many people about it, just 3 maybe along with the people who will read this but i just had to write it down so that i would really know if i should pursue it or not and maybe if someone is kind enough and share a similar story, that would be awesome",89.0,98.0,1568053517.0,CasualConversation

"""take the day tomorrow if you need to- i completely understand!""",emshlaf,"these simple words mean so, so much to me.for context: i am a first-year elementary school counselor. before i got this job, i worked at a preschool for 3 years. this was pre-covid, but people still got sick a lot, especially in the colder months. small children are little germ factories, and the cold and flu season would always hit us like a train. it was not uncommon to have 4 or 5 staff members out sick on some days during the winter months.well, instead of trying to arrange for substitutes or stepping into the classrooms themselves, my admins instead would flat out refuse to let more than a couple of people call out and would force us to come in and work while we were sick. pretty much every time i tried to call out, the response would be, ""well, we *really* need you today. can't you just come in for the morning?"" and so i'd come in for the morning, only to be told that they actually needed me all day. i never put my foot down and insisted i was too sick to work because i was worried about getting on my bosses' bad side... so i would come to work sick and likely infect several dozen children, then end the day feeling 100 times worse than i did at the start.fast forward to today: i've had a cold all weekend and was hoping i'd feel better by today, but i'm still feeling pretty gross. i emailed my boss to tell her i may call out tomorrow, but that i'd let her know for sure in the morning. her response--which i quoted in the title of this post--was everything i could have possibly hoped for.it seems like such a silly thing to be happy about, but after years of being denied the basic human right to rest and recover from an illness, i finally am seeing what it's like to have an employer who actually gives half a shit about their staff. and it feels really, really good.",8.0,2.0,1320781816.0,CasualConversation

do you ever feel alone even though you have friends and a good family?,Jimbo9089,"i'm more of a loner. i like being alone. but i also like having friend's just for the hell of it. it's nice to share my interests with someone if they'll listen. just not all the time. i'm also kind of a different person then all my friends (which is not many). i have very different views and interests then alot of people my age and i can't talk to anyone about them. im a very sensitive person and no one really seems to remember or even give a shit.so the whole reason i'm actually posting to reddit when i usually don't is i had a little squabble with my closest friend. she's really the only friend i constantly talk to. the whole argument was admittedly pretty stupid. but i got defensive and tried to argue my point because she was being very rude to something i like. something i'm apart of. i hate arguments because i really don't like making people upset but sometimes someone says something and then i gotta say something you know? but she's an awful person to have an argument with because the second you disagree with her or your trying to talk your point, she either says ""i don't want to hear it"" or just hangs up like she just did. and it sucks. the second she gets mad and i'm actually coming up with a good point she totally shuts me down. i really do like hanging out with her because we have good laughs alot of the time and there's a few common interests we have. but every now and again we'll have a stupid little argument like this. and another thing is, i never get mad when we argue. i never raise my voice cos i believe that's not how you get your side across. so it just sucks. i can't ever tell anyone about things i like or my opinions because the person i'm most comfortable with doesn't share my interests and won't even listen to me when i blabber on. and the funny thing is, i'm totally the opposite. i love hearing people's stories and what they have to say. i'm more of a listener then a talker. i'm the person people come to when they have to rant. and i don't mind at all. no matter how boring, i love hearing people's stories. she's exactly the opposite. if it's boring she won't hear it. i'm extremely sorry if any of you read this far. i'm just dumping my thoughts because i have nowhere else to go. i might delete this later on too after my mood has changed.does anyone have anything similar happening with them? like i said, i love hearing other's stories",11.0,29.0,1630197025.0,CasualConversation

got free pizza for doing a good deed,SledgeHannah30,"my rugby team recently ""adopted a highway"" (which basically means we clean the litter from point a to point b).  the street we adopted is the most popular bar hopping street in the city. bars, vape shops, and tattoo parlors line the street along with restaurants, gas stations, and some merchandise stores. so with rowdy drunks and the lack of trash cans, the street in general can get gross. this one area was particularly atrocious and while maybe not technically our jurisdiction (it was kind of a muddy pull off), we couldn't leave the garbage all strewn about. so we got to work and started to clean. about halfway through,  we found a carpet (like a wall to wall carpet) that we put into a nearby empty dumpster.  well, the pizza shop owner across the street came jogging out and immediately, we thought this was going to be a bad interaction. we probably should not have done that retrospectively but it seemed the right thing to do at the time. bracing ourselves for the angry outburst, the pizza shop owner thanked us for cleaning up that area and the street in general. he politely offered some of the dumpster but asked us to please not fill it as he has to pay for it (totally understandable) and then he offered us free pizza! it was the highlight of my week and just thought the good deed needed to be shared. it was just a really kind thing for him to do.

three years of writer's block...gone,97PG8NS,"starting in 2012, while working at a job i hated, i started writing a book to cope and even after i left the job, i just never stopped writing. it took four years with a yearlong break in the middle but i finished it in august of 2016 and let a few close friends and family members read it but i never really shopped it around to any publishers with any real seriousness. it would need a lot of polish to get to a state where it could be sold and i decided to use it as more of a learning experience on how *not* to write a book.almost as soon as i finished the first one, i was struck with inspiration for a second but progress stalled until i created another series of characters that would give the first three a reason for their being and their changes as the story progresses. things were going great and there were nights i pounded out eight to ten pages in a sitting and then, without warning, the inspiration dried up almost immediately. i'd had this happen before and wasn't worried but months turned into a year which turned into two. then covid hit and i still couldn't write. i really began to get down on myself so i shelved it until i was ready to tackle it again and i don't think i looked at it for close to a year.last week i finally started again, slowly piecing together bits i'd written for addition to the story later and getting the timeline straightened out. but tonight, it finally happened. i sat down and started just randomly typing things out and suddenly, the dam burst and for the first time since early 2018, i can see clearly in my mind how i want this to proceed and eventually wrap up. i am so beyond happy that i almost cried. i know it sounds weird but to have these characters 'speaking' to me again after such a long silence is the greatest relief in the world and even though i don't have a deadline (as i never have), just feeling that i'll be able to actually finish this one is such a weight off my shoulders.thanks for listening.",4.0,4.0,1613899932.0,CasualConversation

i never used to think of myself as attractive,ifearbears,"i’m 19f, at college right now in my first semester. growing up, especially throughout middle and high school, i didn’t consider myself pretty. frizzy hair, wore glasses, taller than everyone else, quiet, etc. i also didn’t know how to talk to people properly.i kinda figured myself out as i went, learned how to work with my hair and everyone else eventually caught up with and passed my height so that evened out. after i graduated high school i developed more self esteem and accepted my body a bit more, i’m a lot more confident now and gained a ton of conversation skills from my gap year job. i had a lot of friends there from all ages, and a lot of them kept telling me i was really pretty/beautiful. did not believe it at first, but hearing that for the first time in years was really good for my self esteem, even if i didn’t really believe them.i moved into my college’s residence in september, and my 3 roommates are great. they’re all super pretty, especially the one girl who was very popular and is just classically beautiful. i really felt out of place a bit for the first little while, because girls like her were the type to bully me in school. she’s awesome though. we always go out together, and went to the bar once my one roommate finally turned 19 so we were all legal. all of us were hoping to get some free drinks that night as it was my friend’s birthday, but none of the guys were paying attention to it.a guy approached me in line and we started a conversation about his job, then went separate ways once we went inside. we were at our table, and a different guy came up to me. he struck up a conversation and halfway through i mentioned it was my friend’s birthday. he asked if i’d like a drink, and i said yes then he offered to buy for all of us. we talked for awhile and he randomly tried to kiss me in the middle of a sentence, we had some drinks together, then he asked for my snapchat before he left. the guy from the line also went up to my really pretty roommate and told her that i was “really fucking hot” and that he wanted to take me back to his hotel. (avoided him after that, not trying to get kidnapped.) then another guy we talked to for a bit asked for my snap, and when i got home he had sent me something saying “you’re rly hot btw.”my roommates are all joking now that if they want free drinks they just need to go with me, because i “had guys all over me.” it feels so weird to hear that because all these years i was that super quiet girl who no guy was interested in, and now i actually feel somewhat pretty. idk, it feels nice to finally be comfortable with mysel, but so weird.",26.0,12.0,1561173110.0,CasualConversation

"i've been reminiscing about my time as a ski instructor with it starting to snow, and i thought i would share my absolute favourite story from that time a few years back.",Mr8sen," so i am a ski instructor. while i was training for my level 1 certification, i had this instructor. a semi-young scottish guy who was an absolute joy to work with. always joking around, and genuinely an awesome person. but, during the time we had him as our instructor, a rivalry started between me and him. he had this thing he called the first rule of a ski instructor. if you leave you poles unattended, he will knock them down. if you stick your poles in the snow to adjust your boots, bang, they are now laying down. just standing around and talking and you don’t want to hold your poles, smack, they are now 5 feet away. like he wouldn’t just push them down, he would full on smash them if he had the chance.during our training, after having had this happen twice to me during the same training session, i knew i was going to be a pain in his ass. from then on, if we were standing in line on the slope listening to him teaching, could i reach them and if he left them with out his hands on them, i would knock them down. and he couldn’t even be mad because he was doing the same thing, so he usually just took the defeat with a tired sigh.either way, i finished my training, got my certificate, and started teaching. but i didn’t stop. if i saw his skis and poles outside while he was inside the ski school, he would find that they were now on the ground when he came back. he would always mention it every time he saw me next. call me a “cheeky f\*\*\*er”, and you could just see on his face that he knew that he himself caused this. i had a great time with it. he could be with clients, and i would just walk over and whack them down, and just continue walking. it got so bad that he started just leaving his poles laying down in the snow.one day me and a friend who had witnessed these shenanigans throughout the season and was well aware of what we were doing, were standing around with a larger group waiting for an instructor for our level 2 training. my rival came over, took his skis off put his poles down in the snow and walked into the café to get coffee. i looked at his skis, and then at my friend at said; “wouldn’t it be fun to chuck his ski up there” pointing to the large piles of snow that had collected behind a small almost decorative fence set up around the ski school to protect some trees. without hesitating my friend took the skis and walked over the fence into the piles of snow taking 2 or 3 steps and stabbed the skis into the snow maybe 4 feet behind the fence. they were hidden or anything, but they were not where you would expect them to be. unfortunately, we didn’t get to see his reaction, because we took off before he came back from getting coffee. some hours pass and we are up on the mountain skiing the lift line living the dream while training. we stop on a ledge and wait for the group to catch up. we look down at the chairlift and notice a red dot in one of the chairs. the typical color of our uniform. as it got closer, we saw a bright blue helmet on top of that red suit. we just knew it was him. i was already standing there with my friend and the other guys who saw us move his skis, and as soon as he gets with in distance... he just starts shouting at us with his thick scottish accent. i just burst out laughing, while he was just yelling at us from the chair that was slowly coming over our heads. “you know how f\*\*\*ing annoying that was?! it took me like 5 minutes to find my skis”. all the while, his client is just sitting next to him watching this entire thing unfold. as he passed over our heads he turned around in the seat and just kept on yelling at us, and we were just standing there with tears in our eyes, with a very confused instructor right next to us. we told him the story afterwards.what an absolute legends he was. i hope this brings at least a bit of a smile to your faces today, and have an awesome weekend.",9.0,0.0,1485161129.0,CasualConversation

conspiracy theory: apples airpods pros are designed to end up broken or lost.,tinget-stercore,"i’ve used a few different brands of bluetooth earbuds and recently i got some airpod pros. i’ve noticed that this product seems to have been designed so that it is significantly easier to have your earbuds fall right out of its case. literally every single time i’ve dropped the case, on multiple different surfaces including carpet, they have shot out from the case and landed metres across the room. the lid on the case is very flimsy and doesn’t take much force to open and the earbuds themselves aren’t securely fixed in the case whatsoever. the case itself isn’t bad quality or poorly made it just seems to have been designed in a way that would maximize its ability to shoot out earbuds when dropped, especially when compared to other brands like raycon or even other airpod cases, the more horizontal design seems more inclined to this issue than the earlier vertical case. it is my opinion that the case was designed so that the airpods are more likely to end up lost or broken forcing you to buy more and tbh i wouldn’t expect any less from apple. am i assuming to much malicious intent from apple or does it seem feasible that apple would purposefully make the case like this?",15.0,3.0,1563840285.0,CasualConversation

how do i get over the end of a friendship?,hs2508,"i'll try and keep this short, although it is quite a long story. we've been friends almost as long as i've been alive, went to school together, went to uni together. i'd say our friendship peaked in the last few years of school. at uni, we moved in together about six months ago. at first it was fine, but gradually the way she was treating me got worse and i couldn't deal with it very well. at this time i was pretty depressed and struggling to cope with all that was going on, needless to say the way she behaved didn't help. it got to the point where i'd receive very aggressive texts from her on the daily about not 'pulling my weight' and constantly comparing me to our other flatmate. she also got a new boyfriend, who just like the last, is an extremely problematic person. there's a lot more detail i could go into but i'll choose not to. basically, a few weeks ago we had a very heated dispute about some very minor things, and the stuff she said made me realise i was no longer interested in being her friend, never would be again. i'm now in the process of getting my own place and moving out. i don't regret my decision at all, and i know that it's over. but i'm not used to friendships ending like this, and from what mutual friends are saying she's being particularly strange now.basically, what's your best advice for getting over the end of a friendship? i could really use it, i'm trying so hard not to hyper-fixate on this situation but it's honestly getting to me now. i just want to feel fine with it. any advice welcome :)",3.0,3.0,1613745427.0,CasualConversation

i just turned my life/career around and so far it feels unreal,Nudelraiben,"spoiler: might fall asleep for a bit, post won't be abandonedi'm 28m, failed university a few years ago but have a degree in very basic it stuff. i worked in a call center for a bit because i never had money (grown up poor, always lived on support when living alone (school, training, university).then i had plans to move to a different city with a friend (we planned to do that years before, but i cancelled it because i had a new girlfriend). sadly we weren't as connected anymore and it seemed like he didn't actually want to move together. so i cancelled it.. again.i didn't want to keep my call center job though, because of a case where vulnerable people where customers (or better said their patients) were exposed in a very dangerous situation (you can ask for the full story, otherwise i keep it short).and here we are.. jobless, no alternative, no plan. i could've tried to study again, but i still didn't know what exactly and the state only supports 1 more chance basically (then it gets expensive).now.. i did learn a few things during all this time. i noticed that i like to organise and plan things as a job. also that i like to lead, teach and take responsibility. and last but not least: teamwork can be really fun, just as working with decent customers.now i thought it makes sense to get a new training at a company that fits. industrial clerk (google translate said that's the correct name) seemed to make sense.if you're not from germany this might be a little confusing now, so i'll try to make it short but also make sense to you. we have an organ that is supposed to help you get back into a job, i'll use the word 'jobcenter' even though that isn't technically correct for the whole ordeal.while they supposedly act in your favour, the truth is very dark grey. they do everything to keep you out of the jobless statistics, no matter if it's the best choice for you or them in the long run.besides blocking applications and holding back information they also have a prominent reputation for being very unreliable (to not say incompetence). i was allowed to endure this for years, with breaks on between.now of course this isn't representative for everyone working there. i had a few very decent, helpful and competent contacts, but especially the last months were very heavy.now to the good news: i made it. i found a company that will train me in a shortened time frame while also paying me properly for that time. afterwards i'll make a very decent amount of money. also this job is absolutely safe for the future and plays into all my strengths. it has been very difficult to proof myself and i definitely made far too many mistakes that led me to this. but i'm happy that, besides all the downs i experienced, nothing could finally break me. i didn't harm myself in any permanent way like addictions or isolation. i finally got my life back and i hope i'll realise this during the next weeks.tl; bad decisions, bad luck and the universe made me waste quite some years. fought my way through paperwork and a stubborn system to finally get a great alternative.",11.0,2.0,1534524829.0,CasualConversation

i’m starting to feel like a bad friend for not texting my mates first.,jemappellelara,"hi all,so i’m into my first two months of first year at university, and i made a wide range of friends from everywhere (flatmates, coursemates, others in my accommodation, people that go to my uni). naturally, i started to become closer with certain people more than others (based on how often i see them). the weird thing is, i don’t text people i’m closest with every day because i always feel as though i’m bothering them if i were to even say a simple “hello, you alright?”, yet when we are face to face, i could have a smooth, consistent, flowing conversation without it being a silent or awkward moment. i don’t know what’s wrong with me, maybe i just don’t like texting? the only thing is, when i text said people, it’s only when i feel like texting them, if i “need”/“want” something from them, or there’s something urgent. i didn’t see this as a big deal at first, but now i realise maybe this is what is preventing me from having close. one time, i went out for coffee with a girl in my course and then i now barely talk to her unless it’s to see if she’s going out tonight. another thing holding me back from texting is the fact that people don’t text me first anyways. therefore, i don’t feel that they too are interested in me as much as i am them, probably because they see i don’t text them so they don’t bother.i’m not an introvert by any means; i like to talk to people, enjoy myself with good company, and like to hang out and always down for a night out. however, this problem i have is so bad to the point where i haven’t even talked to most people from back home yet. i feel like a shit from for only texting when i feel i need to text instead of reaching out to people myself.is it normal to have a closer connection with someone when you see them in person than by text or social media? or is it a dick move to only talk to people when you see them but not any further? should i make the effort to reach out to people more? would this make people be more willing to text me? any and all advise is needed and welcomed!",8.0,3.0,1630115152.0,CasualConversation

does anybody else love but hate the finale episodes of tv shows?,ThaProtege,"like looking back at that 70s show finale and how the credits were the same as the first episodes and all that happened in the show itself. or the finale episode of futurama and how they went through life together in a pause world, just to be offered a chance to go back without memory and doing it all over again and they do it. knowing that shows history and my own personal history (relationships, people i watched the show with, etc) with the shows and episodes also bring nostalgia. or the fresh prince of bel-air finale where everyone is in the house in the end scene, everyone going their own ways and starting their lives while will stays in california and the college but the lights being turned off and the pan of the house. or the friends finale episode where everyone is moving on and going their own ways too, with the finale pan of the apartment.like i love the finale episodes because they have a lot of meaning behind them and a lot of them time shows conclusions on things we've been watching through the whole series and the episodes are usually good and sentimental. but damn is it an emotional thing too. i'm already not the biggest fan of nostalgia because it just makes me miss a certain time period/frame, usually giving me emotions of family,  old relationships and friends and realizing i can never go back to rhat time, i can never relive those moments and i could never feel that same energy again and the fact i will never be the same, that i'm only getting older and in some ways things were better back then (mentally, financially or whatever). it just brings on a lot of fear for an indefinite and questionable future, and a lot of pent up emotions, doubts, worries, feelings and memories. on the other hand nostalgia is great because it makes you remember those times, even though that's not always helpful or beneficial. but overall it sucks knowing we won't be able to ever relive that and feel that again. only memories (that may or may not sta) and feelings. but seeing the characters in shows going on to live their lives does make you optimistic in ways but then you realize it's just a show and then you see these actors and actresses in reality, completely different people, doing completely different things and in completely different places, some don't even remember the show they acted on, which makes you realize the emotions you have about the finales and shows aren't all that important, you feel stupid for caring about those emotions so much but then they are just there now. we know we'll never see characters again, we'll never know what happened to the characters after the finale, we'll never know where their paths are now, where the relationships went, what else was done and seen. like there's so much possibility and it just seems too open. like yes, shows are an art and arts usually are meant to have open interpretations but honestly it's just not enough sometimes. a lot of people love the fact that people are choosing their own storylines for characters after the show, but me, i want something canon and legitimate, not just assumptions, even if it is just a show. finales definitely are a complicated but simple thing, especially if done correctly. what do you think about finale episodes in shows?",3.0,5.0,1635148719.0,CasualConversation

'sweating', for those who haven't heard of this term, is when someone is trying that hard to win a match, that they actually start to get sweaty palms. this term is used when people use toxic/exploit-y methods to win a match, such as pre-firing their whole magazine, holding pixel angles, crouch spamming, tilt spamming and more. these make the person much more difficult to shoot at, let alone kill.**most players are like this now, and it saddens me every time i play the game. i try to enjoy the game, because that's what it was originally made for, however, it is becoming much harder to do.**cheaters are another issue with siege, especially on console - the platform i play on - xbox series s. players are now using 'mouse and keyboard adapters' such as xim and cronus, so that they can trick their console into thinking that their mouse and keyboard is a controller. simply, it makes any game playable with mouse and keyboard. this is quite unfair and gives them a huge advantage against us controller players, since they can aim easier, have higher sensitivity, have much quicker movements, anti-recoil and much more. it ruins the games, since you have to purposely try harder to beat them and this is something i don't like doing. strikepacks and cronuses are anti-recoil devices for console. they make the recoil either very low or non-existent, meaning that the gun will not move upwards or sideways when shooting. this is also unfair and has it's advantages, however, it's not that hard to beat these types of users.*cronuses are terrible, simple as that. for anyone who has used them or is thinking of using them...don't. they are the most inconsistent and annoying things to use, even when set up. yes i had one and used it, but i don't anymore. i tried it out once, for a few days, and set it up in terrorist hunts/training grounds. never in a online match, since i couldn't get it to work well enough for them. i'll admit, i shouldn't have bought one in the first place but hey, can you really blame me? considering how bad siege has became?*anyways, what do yous think of siege? specifically the way it's gone downhill and hasn't been doing well...also, the cheaters. what do yous think of them?*sorry for the rant. hehe.*my gamertag is justjck, in case anyone wants to play. west eu servers.",5.0,12.0,1579687221.0,CasualConversation

i’m sad to leave my roommates cats,needless_rebel,"i’ve been renting a room and living with a few roommates for about the past year and a half. im a huge animal lover and my roommate has 2 cats that i’ve gotten really close to. one cat is super cuddly and social, and we’ve made a type of schedule of when she comes into my room. it always starts in the morning when i get wake up and go to the bathroom. the cat waits for me by the door and then when i get out she follows me to my bedroom. then she stays in the room with me while i get ready for class. i take her out of the room when i leave, and then at 1 o’clock every day she comes back into my room and pretty much chills and cuddles with me all day. usually the first thing she does is crawl into my lap and lay on my chest. whenever she leaves my room to eat, she always meows at my door until i let her back in. she has so many cute personality traits that i’ve picked up on too.the other cat is a lot less social and doesn’t like strangers. but after a year i finally got her to like me and now she likes me more than anyone else. she is starting to trust me and sometimes let’s me pet her now. she’s gotten a lot more comfortable around the house too because she used to be skittish but now is more relaxed. she likes to sneak into my room whenever i open the door. she doesn’t have a schedule with me, but whenever she hears my door open she comes flying as fast as possible inside lol and today for the first time she finally cuddled with me. the thing is, i’m a college student right now and i just want to go back home to my family so bad. i have lots of pets at home that i miss and i just want to go back. i’ve made the decision to switch to online classes and move back home early during winter break. the only thing that i am sad about leaving is the two cats. i love them so much and i’ve gotten so close to them. the cats like me more than their own owners because the owners are always gone. and the skittish one finally started to relax and get close to me. i obviously can’t take the cats with me though cuz their owners love them too and have had them for almost a decade. but it just makes me so sad that i have to leave them and i’ll never see them again. i only have 6 full days left with them and i’m just so sad about it.i just needed to get this off my mind and share it with someone so that’s why i’m posting here. but yeah, i’m gonna miss them so much.",3.0,7.0,1605588204.0,CasualConversation

what did i miss by not going to high school?,Rebzs,"i graduated from an online school, one that i had been attending since the 6th grade. i made the decision to transfer so that i could dedicate more time to my career interest/passion by working at my own pace and finishing the typical school day earlier.i'm now 17, and it's been almost a year since i graduated. i'm working an entry level job to make use of my newly found empty days, and what i realized very quickly after starting is that this is my first time routinely interacting with people in almost 5 years. most people i work with recently finished high school as well, often times reminiscing about their previous four years, stories that i surprisingly found myself engaged in.which really made me ponder. throughout what would have been my high school years i'd convinced myself that school culture was just not an environment that i would thrive in. that i would loathe the constant drama of who's dating who, the thought of dealing with bullies, or the very likely possibility that i would become incredibly lonely and be reminded each day. i reasoned that i would be far more comfortable once everyone's hormones calmed down, and as a plus i'd be able to obtain a decent job due to focusing on building my skillsets.however because of that trade i predictably don't have very many friends, and even fewer friends i'd call close. i often see co-worker's phones stacked with messages and notifications from friends, while the only thing i received was instagram suggesting me an account i might know. i didn't know that account.i have had some amazing experiences because in light decision though. i got my first freelance animation gig when i was 14, leading to me animating for an indie feature film. that community was awesome, i bonded with the production team and i loved interacting with fans who were enthusiastic about the project. it didn't last though, the sequel was cancelled due to lack of success which lost the interest of the fanbase. i still keep in contact with the production team but we don't talk for more than a few minutes at a time every couple weeks.i feel like i missed an opportunity to form deep connections bound by countless shared memories rather than just similar interests. i start to think that i didn't need to start a career path so early, that it wasn't a time-sensitive case and that i'd end up in the same place years down the line. but making memories might not be so generous.i seek the wisdom of some older folk. how important was high school to you? when and where did you meet your current best friends? i'd also be curious to hear what current high school students have to say about their ongoing lives as well.",4.0,9.0,1600416717.0,CasualConversation

what was the worst mistake you ever made?,EmeraldInTheTopHat,"so, when i was eleven, i wanted to write my own book about time travel (never happened lol) and i wanted to write it on a computer because i knew no one would take a handwritten story. my family had a  desktop computer no one used (2009 dell) and they gave it to me so i could write my story- set it up in my room and everything. i typed...and typed...and typed...(this was the first day i had used it) and then i tired of that. (backstory: me and my friend had been friends for a long time, but there was a point where me and her couldn't see each other irl and neither of us had a phone, so we decided to pen pal. the problem was, she had a very...uniquely spelled name. me and her liked each other a lot and she'd told me how to spell it, but i forgot and was too embarrassed to ask again. our moms were friends on facebook, and they'd only ever talked to get me and my friends addresses (so they weren't like, mutual or anything) so i wanted to go on facebook to see if her mom had ever mentioned my friends name so i could see how to spell it (i was a snoop, i know...)so fast forward, i google ""facebook"" and click on the link. my dad warned me not to click anything that wasn't proven safe (we had mcafee) and i just...my stupid fingers clicked the first link before i was ready, and then something popped up. it was probably something telling me it wasn't safe, but i decided it was an ad, and was only focused on the x button to close it to proceed. well, what do you know, a message from microsoft. ""your computer has been infected with a trojan malware, call blah blah blah for help."" i froze. my dad would be so pissed. my mom would be too. i didn't understand the seriousness of what i'd done, considering the laptop that was connected to it...it had all our family information on it...all our videos, pictures...all on hard drives that could've been infected by me and held for ransom had they not been saved for good just a day ago. (so they couldn't be infected. the laptop and computer themselves...well, they could've been junk.) i called mom in there sheepishly and she shoved me out of the way, and with motherly instinct and panic, called the number for the microsoft place on the tab. the guy who was talking to her was really nice ""oh, my daughters have done the same thing lol...tell your girl it'll be alright, we'll have it fixed in no time at all.) and he proceeded to get some info so he could get on the computer to fix it. meanwhile dad was pulling down the driveway, and i was so scared. he would never psychically harm me ever, but i just would never him know in the first place. ever. he would metaphorically kill me. he came home and i tried to act natural and helped him move furniture out while mom was on the phone with the microsoft dude. i got so worked up i fell and cut my knee, (i still have a scar) but i played it off as if nothing happened. well, dad eventually had to come home, and i walked behind, hoping mom had fixed the computer already. well, she hadn't and dad asked who she was on the phone with. i played dumb. she came up front and told him and i ran back to my room. he yelled for me to come up there and chewed me out good. i stayed distant and sobbed my eyes out while my sister was just sitting in the corner like ""sis, tf ?"" all was tense until we finally realized after we'd given info to the microsoft dude...he was the fecking hacker. he'd tricked us, and we'd trusted him. i'd never felt so betrayed and hurt...well, shit. we saved the computer and everything, our info was saved, we had to change every one of our passwords though, and get a new internet router because that got infected...that led to four weeks with no internet because they decided to be slow with giving us a router...well, i got my computer back after a few months, had close supervision for the next three weeks, and after that...i've developed trust issues. that's my worst/dumbest thing i've ever done. what about you?",8.0,11.0,1637372049.0,CasualConversation

how much will houses cost in 20+ years?,Beautiful-Icicle,"this was just a random thought that popped in my head today. on my way to work, i drove by a house that is three stories high and probably about 4/5 bedrooms and 3 bathrooms. i heard from their neighbor that the house cost $700,000. my parents have the same size house and back 20 years ago, it was only $250,000.not only is this concerning to me, but i am thinking that my son will probably just rent in like 20 years because the housing market would be impossible. unless, of course, he is making a killing in his job.edit: it makes me feel a lot better to be oad in a sense that if my son needs help later on, we would be able to help him. 3 years ago, i would have never thought about this.. but as i grow older and take notice of things around me.. i can probably only afford one child in the future. right now, we could manage two, but most likely in the future, we would probably be struggling and i would not be able to retire because i would feel like i would need to help them out a lot to have a much easier life.

we should change how the calendar works.,BilingualThrowaway01,"the gregorian calendar that we use doesn't line up with the seasons, which kinda bothers me. for a start, the solstices and equinoxes occur at random points throughout the year. also, why are there so many months with 31 days when february only has 28?i came up with a new calendar that works better with the temperate seasons:###winterdecember - 30 daysjanuary - 30 daysfebruary - 29 days###springmarch - 31 daysapril - 31 daysmay - 31 days###summerjune - 31 daysjuly - 31 daysaugust - 31 days###autumnseptember - 30 daysoctober - 30 daysnovember - 30 days^(the new year would still begin on january 1st, i've just structured it like this so it's easier to see the difference between the seasons)the new calendar would also be shifted back so that the summer solstice occurs on june 1st, the autumn equinox occurs on september 1st, the winter solstice occurs on december 1st and the spring equinox occurs on march 1st. leap years would work exactly the same, with february getting 30 days instead of 29.this new calendar, which i unimaginatively call gregorian mark 2,  would still have 365 days but the start points and lengths of the months now coincide better with the orbit of earth.for example, there would be exactly 93 days between june 1st and september 1st, which is how long it takes for the earth to move from the summer solstice to the autumn equinox. it also means that the months perfectly match the seasons, with the midpoint of january marking the coldest part of the year for the northern hemisphere instead of early february. imo this calendar structure just works slightly better with our current understanding of how the seasons work.if i've made any errors let me know.",8.0,24.0,1587853178.0,CasualConversation

i'm not feeling too good about my friendship,VicToriA004,"so it appears that in a few months the new spiderman movie is gonna be in movie theaters and such, only not my town (yet at least), but a lovely town that's a 6 hour drive away which happens to be my favorite town in my country. my friend was super excited, as she is a big marvel fan. i jokingly said we could pack our bags and make a trip there, but also immediately added that if we did i'd have to meet her outside the theater after the movie as i am not into movies. and for the record, she knows i'm not into movies. i like cartoons and animations, movies are like boiled carrots on the side of my dish, don't like 'em but sometimes end up eating them anyway. my friend has already made me watch most of the marvel movies, just so she could watch the avengers movies with me. i didn't really like the experience, i had expressed that many times. but she seemed really eager so i was like ""eh what's the worse that could happen? we'll watch about 10 movies or something and it'll be over"" and well, it's not. first wanda vision came out, then the loki series, then the animation series (which i mostly watched because it's not a movie per se so i enjoyed it more) and so on and so forth. well, apparently she wasn't too happy about me not wanting to watch the movie. she asked why, and my first reason was that i haven't seen the prior two movies about spiderman, which she said we will watch on the way. the way being a 20 minute flight (her choice of transportation). and if you're wonder how it's possible, sometimes she ""speed shows"" me movies, as in she will skip over most of the movie except for the parts she likes or finds important. not exactly fun, but hey i'm just trying to get out of this. but this time, in reply to her saying we would watch the two movies on the way, i said ""i'm not a big movie fan, what do you expect of me [laughing emoji]""that didn't sit too well with her. she sent me a poker face sticker, a gif from hulk saying ""you bad friend"" and then said ""i won't talk to you anymore :)"". i wasn't too sure if she was serious or not, so i tried to play it off saying how could you do this to meee or that i don't give her a hard time for not watching animations with me (which happens like once every two months? less?)but she didn't reply to me until the next morning, when she said ""if you don't like to watch them then tell me i'll simply erase the thoughts and i won't bother you with them"". i'm honestly mad, not sure if i have the right to be. i told her that two individuals don't just erase the thoughts they don't have in common with eachother. and i said that i have no problems with her talking about marvel stuff, i like listening to her and that i even send her any good or funny fanarts i see (she usually likes them) but if she decides to get offended when i don't want to watch a movie i don't know what to do. i'm also unfortunately incredibly stubborn, so the more i feel like she wants to make me watch those movies, the more i want to never look at them, and it's not like i told her we could go watch together, made plans then said i don't like the plan. we made a hypothetical plan, which we both knew wasn't gonna happen because her mother wouldn't allow her to go on such a trip yet, and even in our imaginary plan i stated that i'm not going to watch the movie.and its not the first time i feel bad this way. every time for the past year, when she wanted us to meet up and i didn't want to, couldn't or had other plans, she said it's okay but immediately added that it was probably our last chance to see eachother and she wanted to see me ""one last time"". she used to live in my city, but then her parents moved to the capital of the country and she moved back when covid started and she couldn't go to school. she even made me feel so bad one of the first times that i agreed for her to come over the day before i had an olympiad exam when i had already said no. she wanted to meet up last friday when i already had plans, and when i said no she pulled the ""i just wanted to see you for the last time"" card again. i told her not to say that again because she's been saying that for the past year and not even once was it true or did she move back. but she said ""but this time it's finalized"" and i keep wondering, is she doing this on purpose? sorry for the long post, just needed to get it out.",2.0,3.0,1585653166.0,CasualConversation

my local sonic restaurant had a really dumb system for ordering (like 15 years ago),Ramza_Claus,"so, their flagship sandwich is the sonic burger, a big patty with lettuce, tomatoes, onion, pickle ketchup and mayo.many years ago, when you'd order, you'd have to choose mayo or mustard. and they'd ask you""did you want that with mayo or mustard?""and i don't like either. so i'd say""neither, please. no mayo or mustard""but their register didn't have a button for this. when you pushed the sonic burger button, you'd have to select ""mayo"", ""mustard"" or ""plain"" next. in my case, they'd select ""plain"" since that seemed to be the closest to what i wanted. but i don't want that. i still want all the veggies. in fact, i'd be fine with extra veggies. but i just don't want sauce of any kind (back then they didn't come with ketchup by default like they do now). so my order goes back to the kitchen and the cook sees ""sonic burger - plain"" and he makes me a burger on a bun, with nothing else. the small town i lived in had only one fast food place, and it was this sonic, so i went there semi-often. they served me a plain burger like 5 times and i'd have to go back and get it fixed. eventually, i'd order it as a ""sonic burger --- mayo, with no mayo"" and they'd ring it up as such and the kitchen understood it every time.",5.0,3.0,1357702324.0,CasualConversation

transitioning from in person to online learning changed my academic career for the better,dantheeel,"prior to the events that unfolded in the q1 of 2020, i found myself facing the challenges of remote learning from home and moving on from learning in person; i initially believed this to be the worst-case scenario, as all my elective courses are hands-on and encourage applied learning for students to practice real-life work skills. i contemplated the final moments of my time on campus and worried for what the future beheld for me and how i was going to make the most of my college experience online.the first couple of months proved to be an uphill battle and one that i wasn't prepared for; lectures were taught on zoom which motivated me less to attend because of the lack of resources available to the professors and how it affected their ability to teach the students. i found myself having a hard time trying to grasp the material and retain it for a period of time since most of what was taught was picked up through active recall; another reason why the environment was unwelcoming. i absolutely despised remote learning with a passion and would go on to get sub-below average grade results at the end of the spring semester. they were some of the worst final grades i've received throughout my academic career and that's what did me in and motivated me to discipline myself and prove that i was a better student than this and that no sort of learning environment will change the potential i bring to the table.after the letdown that was the spring semester, i immediately, without hesitation enrolled in two general education courses elsewhere that were required for my program. i didn't know what to make of these courses but i told myself that no matter the circumstance, i will do what is required for me to obtain the highest possible grade. they were not courses that were well-rounded and suited for my major, but i still knew that the best thing to do was suck it up, and get the job done, and i can thankfully say that i did just that. i pushed myself to put in the time, dedication, and effort, to obtain the highest level of satisfaction and redemption. i was engaged, committed, and intrigued by what i was learning and managed to apply most/all aspects of the course content that was being covered. thanks to this change in attitude and perspective, i was able to position myself for success and work through all the hard comings from beginning to end, earning an overall a grade in both courses.after the summer classes were done, i enrolled in three elective courses with the same mindset; be proactive when the opportunity arises, and push myself to achieve what i most desire. while these classes proved to be more of a challenge than the last two in the spring semester, i was able to make the most out of all of them. i attended all the necessary zoom lectures and listened to the professors give their wisdom and insight which i applied for myself. the hardest shortcoming for me at the time was learning from reading the textbook; as stated previously, active recall wasn't my strong suit and something i lacked which meant i had to find alternative ways to pick up on lecture notes. but the semester overall went satisfactory and i exceeded my expectations for the semester by a long shot; it was so well recognized that one of my professors from the college sent me a letter of recognition as follows, ""great work in cis 130 dan! i have been teaching computer technology for over 40 years and you have been the best that i have had. not only are you bright. i have had bright students before but they didn't work hard- you did! many bright students could not articulate what they learned; you did an excellent job with your reports. it'll be my honor to recommend you for jobs or future degrees."" not only did that professor boost my academic performance, but he also helped me obtain my first ever certification (testout's ""certified pc pro""); it became one of the most memorable moments in my academic career.the final semester for the once dreaded but now enjoyed online learning environment was in the summer of 2021 in which i enrolled in only two classes. these two classes were one step above the previous three but didn't deter my ability to perform. they lasted only from june to august, which meant more demand and potential to bring to the table, which i did. the workload became overwhelming in some parts of the curriculum, but i kept my cool and retained the disciplinary attitude for a good cause. in the end, i finished strong with convincing test scores and final grades. this was the final time i would take an online class, and i'm now reflecting back on it and it now makes me cherish those feats that i pulled off before.working remotely from home wasn't on everyone's bucket list, and while many suffered the harsh reality of it all, some people like myself took it as an opportunity for redemption and going beyond one's limits to reach new heights and achieve great feats that nobody could've imagined. this global pandemic proved that one can make the most out of an unlikely situation if enough heart and motivation is the driving force for one to succeed. i now am thankful for the remote experience and being under lockdown as it taught me that good things happen to those who dedicate their lives to what they desire most. i will never forget the uplifting experience that online learning has brought to me.",1.0,0.0,1637068909.0,CasualConversation

unknowingly foreshadowed my own life,ceddreams,"i went through tough times at 16 after i had my life drastically changed by agreeing to spending 2 months abroad. for a while, i thought it was an unpredictable, unheard of, tragic result to a series of misguided errors while being manipulated by an adult. however, recently i came across something i wrote about 2 weeks in my trip and i realised that all the signs were already there. all of the things i now recognise as manipulative behaviour had their seeds planted the moment i landed on that country. that little essay of mine is filled with foreshadowing basically. i was aware that that person had an agenda and was trying to change my mind to a certain extent... and i complied, i fell for it despite recognizing that behaviour.reading it back, it is astonishing. it is the perfect ""introduction"" that foreshadows the craziest and most challenging year of my life.what has the power of hindsight revealed about your life?",6.0,4.0,1607910660.0,CasualConversation

what is it that makes these little kids love me so much?,gecot63542,"i (19m) work part time at my old childhood elementary school as both the librarian and cafeteria clerk, and i've been working over there for about 14 months now.towards the end of my shift, i also join the kindergarten class out for lunch recess every day and spend some time running around and playing with them, because their class doesn't come to the library this year, so this is my way of interacting with them. this is the same class that i used to be a volunteer helper for l when they were in preschool, for the very first month i worked at the school last year, so i already have a history with them.i mainly just run around and play ball/tag/hide and seek/duck duck goose with the kids, watch them when they want to show me something they can do, or tell them stories (both fictional tales and real stories my own childhood). one thing that the kids really love to do is to chase me and pull me over to ""jail"" were they basically sitting me down in time out for *stealing money"" and then chase me down if i try to run away. it's like their favorite game ever.more recently, i reintroduced ""mr. hippo"", a plush stuffed hippo doll that i'd use as like a puppet and make it talk and move around. last february through april, i used it while reading to the little kids (preschool through 1st grade), and then i'd let the teacher pick the best behaved kid to hold mr hippo for the rest of their library visit. this month, i brought him back, and not only use him for the library, but for recess with the kindergartners as well (although some of the girls are starting to misgender him and call him ""mrs. hippo).let me tell you though, i love this part of my job, those kids are just so cute and adorable, and the way they get excited and shout my name when they see me coming from like 100ft away always puts a smile on my face.but i have to wonder what it is about me that makes these kids so excited when i come around. i know little kids are known to like just about anyone, but with me it seems like there's more to it. just last week, i had one little girl say she wanted a hug, and as i gave her one she said ""you're not gonna go"", and when i did try to let go and walk out she was holding on for dear life. another time, i had this little boy in that class yell me i was the best teacher ever while i was on lunch line duty. and they love mr. hippo too, they all want a turn to hold him during recess. one time, this group of kids was like ""get the baby"" and i said mr. hippo's not a baby, to which they said ""yes he is"", and i said ""where is his mommy and daddy, then?"" and this one little girl points at me and says ""you're his daddy!"". and they all started acting like crying babies and pretending i was there dad.this makes me wonder what it is that i'm doing so right, and how i'd do as a dad or teacher in the future?",8.0,2.0,1619577401.0,CasualConversation
