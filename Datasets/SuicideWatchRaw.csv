2048.0,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x00000184EBEFAFD0>,,SuicideWatch,"Im escaping from that hellhole rehab facility. After the adrenaline wore down I was in immense pain last night. I asked to be taken to the hospital. Staff said “why don’t you call 911 again?” I haven’t had my meds in days. I’ve been asking them to refill for 2 weeks because I knew I’d run out soon. 

They told me I was going to be discharged due to my behavior on Monday and that I was to be baker acted because I apparently started a fight yesterday and a bunch of Karen’s gave false witnesses. I asked for my phone and they said I couldn’t have it. I asked to be sent home. I said I was done with treatment. They said they would not let me go home due to my mental state. I kept asking to go home and asking for my phone and they kept insisting I was a danger to myself and others. I eventually relented because I was getting tired of asking to go home and staff telling me no I’m not well. 

I’m not the one who needs to be hospitalized. There’s nothing wrong with me. I’m just depressed and wish to be alone. But these gloomy lunatics won’t let me be. You hit me I’m going to hit you back. That’s that. 

So I played along and said yes I would willing go the the psychiatric facility to start another 60-90 days of treatment. They tried taking me to the psych ward tonight but there was no room. So they said I could stay here one more night but they were taking me in the morning.

Then they fucked up and gave me my phone back. I said “thanks for everything 🥲 I’m going to miss you.” As soon as I got back to my room I packed my bags and booked a flight back home. I don’t even have a suitcase, just laundry bags. 

I stayed up all night watching true crime waiting for the overnight night tech to go to the break room for his nightly nap. I spent 6 months here before and some things never change. 

3 am hit and I called a Lyft. It was 12 mins away. I quietly crept out of my apartment and saw that nobody was outside. I went back in and started to bring my bags downstairs to the gate. My bags were heavy and my right hand was fucked up from the attack. It was brutal. But I kept it together because I knew I needed to get out of there. 

My Lyft arrived and we quickly loaded my belongings in the trunk. My driver was very kind to me and listened to my story and was sympathetic. He drove me to the airport and I’ve just made it to TSA. 

Delta made me sign a waiver that my belongings might be destroyed considering I brought them in laundry bags and not a suitcase. The attendant said she was sorry. I said don’t be, I just need to get the hell out of Florida. TODAY! She smiled and checked 2 of my bags free.

There is nothing wrong with me. I love myself. It’s everyone else that I hate. I wasted 43 days in treatment,without my phone and spent  $15K on top of my insurance to figure that out. 

I am safely on my flight and couldn’t be happier. There is an infant in the seat behind me screeching and wailing. It annoyed me at first but I honestly feel like doing the same. Let her cry.

It’s my birthday tomorrow and I told them weeks ago that if I was still on restriction on 11/11 just send me home. It’s hard enough being in treatment on your birthday, hundreds of miles away from your family and no way to call home. 

It’s going to be a shit show in a few hours when they realize I’m not there. I stuffed a bunch of towels and pillows under my covers and left a silk bonnet there... just to fuck with them.

Love yourself first. Fuck everyone else. There’s nothing wrong with you (YES IM TALKING TO YOU) There’s something wrong with everyone else.

Not only do I beat myself up emotionally, when I bottle everything up I also take out my emotions on other people and anything will fly out my mouth in the heat of the moment. Then afterwards I feel really guilty but because I find it really awkward apologising face to face, I fall into self destruction/sabotage where I won&#39;t eat(or at least I will not eat for about 7 hours until I&#39;ve decided that I&#39;ve &quot;punished&quot; myself sufficiently, and because I&#39;ve been &quot;bad&quot; I don&#39;t even see it as an eating disorder or anything), won&#39;t reach out to any mental health recovery accounts on Instagram/helplines, sometimes it gets so overwhelming that I will feel like I don&#39;t even deserve to have a bath/shower/brush my teeth etc. Mabye this is depression but hey, why should I feel sad about that, because when I&#39;ve bottled up things and then say all this stuff to my parents surely that must be giving them depression too so what gives me the right to reach out to someone</p>

2048.0,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x00000184EBEFAFD0>,,SuicideWatch,"Maybe this makes no sense, but it really is how I feel. I just turned 32 years old and I have absolutely nothing to show for my waste of life. 

I work a dead-end job that I hate, with people that I hate, and I try my best, and people laud me for my efforts, but yet, nothing I do is ever enough. 

I also like to think I'm a reasonably well-adjusted person, I'm not weird (according to people who know me, anyway) and I'm told that I'm kind, friendly, sweet, funny and beautiful, and I have so much love to give, but nobody wants to give me a chance. I've used just about every God-forsaken dating app and dating site and matchmaker under the sun, but I only ever attract sex-hungry fiends who would probably forget I even exist in a half-second, despite the fact that I've made it clear that I'm looking for a serious, long-term connection. I don't see how this is so incredibly unreasonable of me to ask for.

I'm also not desperately throwing myself at every guy I come across, and I'm not projecting the image of someone who wants to walk down the aisle on like the very day I meet a guy, and I don't have a laundry list of ""required"" qualities in a partner, like some women have. I'm not asking for a 7' tall, blonde-haired, strapping supermodel astronaut with a fake tan and a six-pack. I just want a *normal* guy who's at least my height (and I'm 5'7"", so I think that's not too much to ask for) and who doesn't want to just use and abuse me for sex, but in today's modern age of Tinder, that seems to be the most impossible thing in the world. 

It's reached the point where I get panic attacks from just seeing other couples and people with wedding rings, and I wake up regretting the fact that I woke up at all. After struggling hopelessly with suicidal depression for over a decade, my heartache has genuinely evolved into a physical pain in my chest, and I feel it churning in my chest every moment of every day. My only reprieve is my unconsciousness while I sleep, only to be forced to wake up again. 

I desperately hate my life and I want nothing more than for it all to end. I have zero hope - hope is pain and agony, and nothing more. Nothing ever works out for me, and I'm always the one who gets rejected. It's like I asked to be born, so why bother being here? 

I already devised a way out, and the idea of it used to fill me with fear, since nobody truly knows what happens after death (people can only speculate, however certain they might be in their speculations and beliefs). Who's to say there's an afterlife where I might be judged for my misdeeds? Who's to say there's absolutely nothing? Nobody really knows, and I was always afraid of that, but for the first time in my life, I'm not afraid of it at all, and that in and of itself makes me afraid, if that makes sense at all. 

Anyway, until I can gather the courage to depart this miserable world, I'm spending just about every moment of the day praying that some accident takes me away from this world. I have zero interest in languishing for however many more months, years or decades of the same hopeless situation, despite my very best efforts to extricate myself from it. I genuinely envy the people who get hit by cars or trains, or die in their sleep, or get diagnosed with some terminal illness that gives them a year left to live, and, with every fibre of my being, I wish I could give my life to some such person, so that they could take advantage of their life's potential.

Who&#39;s to say there&#39;s an afterlife where I might be judged for my misdeeds? Who&#39;s to say there&#39;s absolutely nothing? Nobody really knows, and I was always afraid of that, but for the first time in my life, I&#39;m not afraid of it at all, and that in and of itself makes me afraid, if that makes sense at all. </p>

<p>Anyway, until I can gather the courage to depart this miserable world, I&#39;m spending just about every moment of the day praying that some accident takes me away from this world. I have zero interest in languishing for however many more months, years or decades of the same hopeless situation, despite my very best efforts to extricate myself from it. I genuinely envy the people who get hit by cars or trains, or die in their sleep, or get diagnosed with some terminal illness that gives them a year left to live, and, with every fibre of my being, I wish I could give my life to some such person, so that they could take advantage of their life&#39;s potential. Why should an innocent child suffer, with all of the promise and potential in the world, while I&#39;m forced to be here? I&#39;d give it all up for a child in a heartbeat.</p>

Who I want to be friends with? How can I find someone who I genuinely care about, if everyone is literally a fucking clone. It feels like I am living in a simulation and the only way to get out is to kill myself or one of the clones. I bet even this post isn't different and others feel the same way as me but I don't know whether that is a good thing or a bad thing.

I honestly don't know what I want to hear. Do I just want to hear that I'm crazy to feel different from others? Because my bland personality and average looks don't set me apart I at least want the trauma and mental illness to make me feel valid enough to exist?

But the thing is, I'm not happy. I haven't been for a couple years now. I wish that I won't wake up when I sleep. I wish that I had the courage to face my fears and finally end it all.

To quote one of his stock famous lines, &quot;Ever tried? Ever failed? Fail again, fail better,&quot; he says, which seems to amount somewhat up to Camus&#39;s idea of life, of how one should always imagine Sisyphus happy. It agonises me to think in that manner, it always seems like a compromise in vain, Sisyphus is not happy at all, in fact, Sisyphus is vexed and wants to kill himself. Why is life so shit and yet so hard to withdraw from?
As a person from the lower middle classes, I&#39;ve often found myself alienated even amongst my peers. They can never really know where I come from, they are from families doing fairly well. My ex girlfriend at a couple of occasions, perhaps unintentionally yet still, made me feel so conscious of my class. I want to have a career in the academia but don&#39;t really have a good foundation for it cause I come from a small town and life in metropolitan seems really futile at this point.

She held a bed for herself and said she didn't want to sleep with me because I snore. We both pregamed and I pregamed and I ended up in the bed she claimed, and she went to the bed of my friend who we'll call (D). Later on, I woke up and was going to check on her. The door was locked with her and (D) in there. ""They said it was only five minutes) but everyone else is telling me it was much longer. I suspect she was cheating on me with him because they've been talking so much lately. 

Further, into the party, I get incredibly drunk, accusing D of fucking my girlfriend. I black out, and I apparently dragged her out of her bed and took her to her original room. I was blacked out and was stumbling and crashing around and she hid in another room locked. 

I understand my behavior was fucking horrendous, I terrified her, and she thought I would hurt her.  I don't remember any of this.

In the morning when I woke up and a lot of friends went out to a diner for breakfast I checked (D's) trashcan and there was a used condom and condom wrapped on the very top of it. 

Based on this I 100% thought she cheated on me. She was predominately in that room, and no other girls that (D) was ever with went upstairs, went with her. I confirmed this with many other people that weren't drunk. 

So, I drove home. Left her 5 hours away in another state. She stayed another night, rather than convincing him to drive her home immediately. (In hindsight I can see why, because what I did was fucked up in itself), but everyone has told me it's so fucking likely she cheated on me. I just kind of snapped and left her there.

On Monday she was driven home by (D) (9 hour round trip) and she stayed with her parents. Today (Tuesday) She came by and grabbed her personal computer and clothes with her brother and mom. 

I assume she was frightened of me because I pulled her out of the bed. I get that, but I confronted her outside alone and accused her of cheating, and she says she doesn't remember. (It was a haze). I essentially told her to pack her shit and get out. Which is what she seemed to be doing already since she moved her computer and clothes. (Basically starting the breakup). She adamantly denied anything or any wrongdoing. I don't believe her, so I essentially say, this is over, yeah? And she says ""basically it was over when you physically touched me (pulling out of bed) and stranding me 5 hours away). I said it was over when she cheated on me and walked back into my apartment, 

So, I moved cross-country because we met online and have been dating for 8 months in person. I still love her, but this entire situation makes me want to kill myself. I have alcohol and benzos. I'm sure if I take enough I can be done with this fucking life. I'm numb, I'm crying, I hate myself, I hate her, I hate D. I have no one else here. I want to be dead.

I survived a suicide attempt at age 10 by swallowing a bunch of random medicines from the medicine cabinets because I wasn’t making good enough grades (I am a first generation immigrant and didn’t want to fail at life) in the 4th grade. Crazy, I know. But I survived it and went on with my life ever since.

After sixth grade, it became harder for me to connect with people and make friends. I feel like during the middle school years, people started getting cliquey for the purpose of finding themselves and where they belong in the world. I never belonged anywhere or with anyone. And it made me feel like a loser with no friends, except for one or two. And even they moved onto better people. It continued like this all the way throughout high school and even college. 

In college, I thought that I found a lifelong friend in someone. We actually stayed friends for close to 10 years and have established a strong bond. Then this person got married to someone who hated me and cut off all contact with me at this person’s request. Then in January of this year, I received a text from someone who I thought was this person, but it turned out to be the spouse of my so-called friend pretending to be this friend. 

Found out that my friend had disclosed every single personal details about me to the spouse and the spouse used these details to manipulate me into having a text conversation that turned sexual and coercive in nature. And I found out that this friend was all in on it. I felt so betrayed and worthless. Like I don’t have a friend in the world and that I’m a worthless loser who deserves to be treated like this. I mean, would it kill me to be a lot more attractive, normal, not socially anxious, not so easily taken advantage of, etc.? These are not great thoughts to have and I’ve been struggling with thoughts of suicide everyday ever since.

To make matters worse, this week is my last week at work. My boss announced this during our regular morning Microsoft Teams meeting, and it was like crickets. No one wished me farewell. No one congratulated me on my new endeavors. And no one wished me well. I feel like had this been pre-Covid, this would have been a farewell party that no one came to. And I feel like a loser whom no one likes or cares for. And it’s not helping with my suicidal thoughts.

Then this person got married to someone who hated me and cut off all contact with me at this person’s request. Then in January of this year, I received a text from someone who I thought was this person, but it turned out to be the spouse of my so-called friend pretending to be this friend. </p>

<p>Found out that my friend had disclosed every single personal details about me to the spouse and the spouse used these details to manipulate me into having a text conversation that turned sexual and coercive in nature. And I found out that this friend was all in on it. I felt so betrayed and worthless. Like I don’t have a friend in the world and that I’m a worthless loser who deserves to be treated like this. I mean, would it kill me to be a lot more attractive, normal, not socially anxious, not so easily taken advantage of, etc.? These are not great thoughts to have and I’ve been struggling with thoughts of suicide everyday ever since.</p>

<p>To make matters worse, this week is my last week at work. My boss announced this during our regular morning Microsoft Teams meeting, and it was like crickets. No one wished me farewell. No one congratulated me on my new endeavors. And no one wished me well. I feel like had this been pre-Covid, this would have been a farewell party that no one came to. And I feel like a loser whom no one likes or cares for. And it’s not helping with my suicidal thoughts. </p>

<p>Sorry for rambling. I just needed to get it off my chest.</p>

But when you're truly suicidal and start to plan, I think that requires a state of mind which finds deep comfort in leaving this awful place. And once you start to embrace that idea, and the pain becomes a nice sensation, you feel as if you're living in line with how you are and feel.

No memory, no suffering, no experience of slavery. Yet, why waist 'food' for economy.

How can I want to do things for society if it doesn't treat everyone the same. People who are in jail are maintained to be the way they are, because why think on how to fix crime which usually happens from stupidity we arose on those who don't have money to afford education, or living situation to maintain studying.

Sure, i can stfu and go back to work, and live like that so people get advantage of me wasting time, while select few have everything already and they not contribute and don't utilize materials so everyone can be equal, in manner of not prospering himself, city, country, economy, but individuals, everyone, or just consciousness in general.

It's like they teach us to work, but not ask ourselves on ""how much money does it take to get rid of it?""

I don't want to sleep unless my body is crashing, I don't want to eat unless it's super painful, it's fucked that we have limits, because essentially we are animals. But manipulating poeple to do this(jobs with obsolescence and no guarantee and etc) because then I won't have a choice to live normal, is a little f\*cked daddy governments. (Because essentially no country just gives out food, free housing, and so on which is not permanently to those who can't contribute in single minded means)

But didn't we did science back in 1950's, even earlier than that, and we still make people starve because they are not good enough to be handed necessities, which we limited using economy not accessible to everyone. Even with us being under surveillances like a property, if you lost paperwork, we won't verify you is you. De fu? Taxes can be filed by others (be hired by gov, not privately) to create even more jobs, but you want to play number version lie detector so then you instead create job catching those who avoid taxes, or even old people sometimes which is sad. To a degree tho I don't feel bad for old people, because they didn't try hard enough to not have future generations suffer less.

What worth then people or I have if I am just another slave who can be compensated by a new born baby, who is being asked to pick their pin code as their parents spend 10's or more thousands of dollars for something what we call ""priceless life"". Assigning automatically newborns with financial responsibility is fucked without alternative(case for lower classes), because obviously if we make poeple to have no money, how we going to sell them a phone that is worse than a next year one? Why not have a better approach to shit in the first place without complaints that only change things in manner to shut poeple up, or sometimes no change at all, amazing how disappointing it gets.

Either way, call-line for suicide prevention not only is motivating me to die more, but pointless overall. Maybe make free mental healthcare instead huh? Why when we find problems, we only patch up our tires, buy new ones, or driving flat, instead of making tires airless in the begginging, or making them affordable, huh?

No no no, we want you to depend and rely on something what could be thaught to you for free, but even then, they will instead just give you no single information on how to be rich quick if that's the only means on how to control zoo with a little bit smarter monkeys.

Assisted suicide even has a age limit, because we want to have means on squeezing if not you, your parents at the least while you still need to eat and so on.

People want you to stay alive, but no one will help everyone to stop suffering, no i'll buy an expensive car that could instead save some kids dying on the other side of this planet.

We haven't found aliens, because they wouldn't just show up to retarded organisms going through mutations assigned by society to cut population and throw money at poeple so they would feel a little secure about their choice to sell soul to capitalism where guarantee for you to live and survive in apocalypse is not even something to be concerned about.

I mean, I'm not lazy, I'm just not stupid to have curiosity in quantum physics and do a job at McDicks, or even if I want to study quantum chemistry, I can't just take shortcuts, because they want to charge me for 4 years in united states for bachelors(limited access data bases). Then even more years to get further certification in ""education"" and not even closer to access to equipment to do experimentations. Sure safety important and i agree it's essential, but teaching kids money before they are in highschool is not important? Huh? So even then an orphan would have to suck it up?

2048.0,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x00000184EBEFAFD0>,,SuicideWatch,"It's getting increasingly hard to imagine that I actually have a ""future."" I detach myself so much I can't believe that my actions now will have consequences later... which makes it hard for me to put any effort into anything because I'm consistently clouded with the idea that I don't exist and everything I do will cease to matter.

Today was an .. absolute mindfuck. For the entire time, I genuinely believed I was dead. I got through the entire day without interacting with anyone and I felt almost like a ghost viewing the world from the underbelly of a fishbowl. On one hand, it felt liberating to not be involved in the chaos of living. On the other hand, I felt so isolated and detached - so much like a ghost I almost didn't care if I could die today, now, even.

I need help, and fast, with being able to ""reconnect"" with my existence again. I'm starting to put myself in dangerous situations because I'm becoming more immersed in the idea that I'm unreal, fake, living in this weird simulation. Hell, I don't know if I'm real typing this. I have to force myself almost everyday now to do something because it's so easy to fall into the trap of becoming nothingness. Late assignments are currently piling up for me and I need to hold my breathe to wake up. Sometimes I crave for a near-death experience to knock the life back into me again - like maybe I almost lose my breathe underwater so I can learn what it feels to really ""breathe"" again. 

It feels like I'm dragging myself through mud. It feels like I'm programmed into this dystopian loop of life everyday and it's so hard to feel ""real"" again. I'm still debating if its a good or bad thing, but it's making it very very easy to just.. end it here. I contemplate about death almost everyday now. I take death not as a scary thing; heck, I don't even consider myself ""suicidal"" anymore because I've been manipulated with this perception that someone who is ""suicidal"" acts as this angry, resentful, emotional person. 

In my case though, I take suicide as something casual. As an option that's there - and an option that'll be okay to use. I take death as a calm, liberating process.

<p>Today was an .. absolute mindfuck. For the entire time, I genuinely believed I was dead. I got through the entire day without interacting with anyone and I felt almost like a ghost viewing the world from the underbelly of a fishbowl. On one hand, it felt liberating to not be involved in the chaos of living. On the other hand, I felt so isolated and detached - so much like a ghost I almost didn&#39;t care if I could die today, now, even.</p>

<p>I need help, and fast, with being able to &quot;reconnect&quot; with my existence again. I&#39;m starting to put myself in dangerous situations because I&#39;m becoming more immersed in the idea that I&#39;m unreal, fake, living in this weird simulation. Hell, I don&#39;t know if I&#39;m real typing this. I have to force myself almost everyday now to do something because it&#39;s so easy to fall into the trap of becoming nothingness. Late assignments are currently piling up for me and I need to hold my breathe to wake up. Sometimes I crave for a near-death experience to knock the life back into me again - like maybe I almost lose my breathe underwater so I can learn what it feels to really &quot;breathe&quot; again. </p>

<p>It feels like I&#39;m dragging myself through mud. It feels like I&#39;m programmed into this dystopian loop of life everyday and it&#39;s so hard to feel &quot;real&quot; again. I&#39;m still debating if its a good or bad thing, but it&#39;s making it very very easy to just.. end it here. I contemplate about death almost everyday now. I take death not as a scary thing; heck, I don&#39;t even consider myself &quot;suicidal&quot; anymore because I&#39;ve been manipulated with this perception that someone who is &quot;suicidal&quot; acts as this angry, resentful, emotional person. </p>

<p>In my case though, I take suicide as something casual. As an option that&#39;s there - and an option that&#39;ll be okay to use. I take death as a calm, liberating process. I don&#39;t imagine myself sobbing in pain, crying, having an emotional breakdown when I commit the deed. Instead, I&#39;ll probably commit like it&#39;s an everyday thing. Like it&#39;s something as casual as eating dinner. </p>

This isn’t life and being dead is 100% the better option in every single way.  This won’t stop and killing myself is the only way to improve things. I would rather be dead than live like this anymore.  I can’t take this anymore.</p>

I don’t feel any emotion except for anger, and I seem to be angry all the time. My anger has been so intense lately that it scares me and the few people left who can tolerate me. 

Tonight I was dealt a major blow. My insurance company won’t cover a medication I need to help me sleep at night. When I don’t sleep, I feel even worse than usual. I was with my partner at his mom’s house when I got the news, and I immediately left to go sob in my car.

But as of recently, I have just given up. That's the simplest way to put it. I am 18 now, and I have gone no where and have done nothing with my life. I look ahead, all I see is a road that keeps going on and on and on leading me, no where. I failed my learners test for driving just a few months ago, I think that was my breaking point. My one last hope to get somewhere was driving, now? I lost that to. My parents never help me and I'm too scared to ask. I am failing my senior year. I have no friends, I know no body besides of family but even then, I'm not close to them. I don't have a job because nobody will hire me in my small town. I have plans for my future but I don't think I'll be fulfilling them any time soon. My anxiety is just too bad to the point where it makes me sick and I lie in bed most of the day crying and feeling sorry for myself, I hate that feeling and I want it to go away so badly. 

But its not and it won't, because I have given up. I don't have any reason to continue on, I have tried. I have tried so, so hard but I can't anymore. People say suicide is cowardly and selfish and I rather be that then to continue suffering in my own personal battle. I don't have a reason to wake up. I don't have a reason to laugh or smile I only have a reason to end this long road of pain.

<p>But as of recently, I have just given up. That&#39;s the simplest way to put it. I am 18 now, and I have gone no where and have done nothing with my life. I look ahead, all I see is a road that keeps going on and on and on leading me, no where. I failed my learners test for driving just a few months ago, I think that was my breaking point. My one last hope to get somewhere was driving, now? I lost that to. My parents never help me and I&#39;m too scared to ask. I am failing my senior year. I have no friends, I know no body besides of family but even then, I&#39;m not close to them. I don&#39;t have a job because nobody will hire me in my small town. I have plans for my future but I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll be fulfilling them any time soon. My anxiety is just too bad to the point where it makes me sick and I lie in bed most of the day crying and feeling sorry for myself, I hate that feeling and I want it to go away so badly. </p>

<p>But its not and it won&#39;t, because I have given up. I don&#39;t have any reason to continue on, I have tried. I have tried so, so hard but I can&#39;t anymore. People say suicide is cowardly and selfish and I rather be that then to continue suffering in my own personal battle. I don&#39;t have a reason to wake up. I don&#39;t have a reason to laugh or smile I only have a reason to end this long road of pain. </p>

All of my friends, family and high school teachers that I still talk to keep on telling me that I have an opportunity here to go to university and if I waste it, I&#39;ll be a failure in life. But I just can&#39;t face it.</p>

<p>I know, I could just refuse, but then I know that I will face massive fights, all alone, that will make me kill myself. Sure, I could present a plan for something else that I could do, but I&#39;ve tried so many things and all have failed. I&#39;ve done nothing in 2 years. I know, I&#39;m still young and could go to university and do something else later, but I won&#39;t make it through university. The stress combined with my debilitating anxiety will make it impossible, even school was hell.</p>

<p>I know that I&#39;ll kill myself before university starts (Feb 2022), but then I think about my cat. He&#39;s so attached to me and sweet and innocent. I don&#39;t care about hurting family with my death, but my cat doesn&#39;t deserve that.</p>

<p>I&#39;m trapped. I either hurt my cat, or attempt university and probably end up killing myself anyway. I love my cat to bits, but I wish I hadn&#39;t gotten him. He turned a year old today.</p>

i had a therapy session to try and “better” my life but it only made me realize how pointless my life is. (tl;dr i wish i could start over)
they asked “how long have you had suicidal thoughts” 
i plainly told them since i was 8 or 9.
they said “you have a history of sexual abuse, how old were you? does this affect you daily?”


“6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17. no i dont remember anything from my childhood. i just know it was bad”
“do you still have suicidal idealation?” of course i lied so they didnt throw me in a mental hospital surrounded by apathetic workers. 
“no, ive accepted it. i have to be here, i just dont want to be here but i know i have to” i started crying because this was the hardest emotion i felt the whole time. im working everyday going to school, doing my internship doing odd jobs. for what? to support a future i dont even want? 
“you said you’ve experienced relationship violence, could you explain?”


after being molested as a child, i found someone i could talk about it with. i was 12 i didnt know he was sexualizing my trauma. i thought he loved me and wanted the best for me. i ran away with him, he screamed at me, cheated on me, watched as i laid in the bathroom everyday with the door locked slipping into psychosis escaping the life ive been forced to live. he told everyone he hated me, that i was horrible to him. he destroyed the house that my teenage heart poured everything into. i decorated the walls with our pictures, i cooked the best i could, i baked, i loved him more than myself but i wasnt enough. so i left. he got with the woman he loved better than me. his family that claimed i was part of the family, his mom that said she would be the mother i never had, betrayed me. they helped him sneak out a be with her while i sliced my wrists open and wrapped them up with toliet paper quietly sobbing by myself in the bathroom. but its fine. i was so used to being thrown away i accepted it. at first, i screamed, i cried i destroyed the house that i poured these 2 years into. but in the end. i accepted it. of course, i just told me therapist. “he was abusive. he punched holes in the wall.” 


“now to your family, you say it kind of crazy. can you explain that?”
“according to my dad my mom kidnapped me when i was 9 months old” and took me 5 states away and raised me with a family who hated me, told me i was ugly, spoiled, annoying, not part of the family. “according to my mom my dad is a schizophrenic psychopath who never wanted me, even though his family who could never see me loved me more than the family you forced on me who abused and hated me. can you tell who i believe more?”



“focusing on the present, youve been diagnosed with general anxiety disorder, major depressive disorder AND bipolar disorder?”
“and possible BPD, yeah.”
“whats the worse thing right now?”
“the panic attacks, they just happen. im not thinking of anything. i just feel overcome with terror and i wanted to escape but i cant. i feel trapped”

i could see she was growing irritated and uninterested with my flat affect so i kept my answers short and started wrapping it up. 



“it sounds like you have a lot of past trauma and present mental health concerns, our clinic doesnt have the capacity for this but we can refer you to another clinic. its 15 a visit, the sliding scale fee.” (third referral)


why would i pay to keep living a life thats been ruined from the start. 
with a broken down car you hate would you keep throwing money into it to fix the problems temporarily or trash it and get a new one. even though i cant get a new life maybe nonexistence is better. even though i hope theres a heaven and i can somehow be allowed there.

Things have just been progressively going downhill for me over the past several years. Every time I do something good and get a step ahead, or start making positive progress in my life, I get thrown back 10 steps and have to start all over again. For fucks sake I'm going to be 31 in 25 days, my parents were so far ahead of me at this age.

Romantic Relationships? Keep ending in me just being used and abused. Me being trans certainly doesn't help THAT fucking aspect of my life, that's for sure. Especially after I started Testosterone. Before T, they could still get away with pretending I was just a very butch woman and I had accepted that so I didn't care as much and could deal with it because I had someone and wasn't alone. Then I started T, relationship I was in fell apart, she cheated on me with a cisman and a ciswoman, and she emotionally abused me for months after moving me across the country to be with her. So I decided to become ""happy"" with myself and being single. And I WAS! Then after nearly 2 years single and on T I decided to try dating again, apparently once you're on T and look male no one wants to even feign interest. Can't even fucking get laid.

Friendly Relationships? What the hell are those supposed to actually be like anyways? Someone I considered my bestfriend, who's held that position for 15 fucking years, now wants jackshit to do with me unless I'm doing every single chore in the house including taking care of their kids, and if I'm spending money on them. Shit that got fucking confirmed LAST night! Some context, we all live together, them, their husband, the 2 kids, me, and another mutual ""friend""(because none of them are mine), all live together. ""Bestfriend"" can't work due to severe anxiety so has never had a job, their husband is a piece of shit who doesn't do a damn thing besides go to work (doesn't clean, I've changed more diapers for both his kids than he has, etc), I pay rent to them for bills plus more for food in the house since we all eat meals together, but I have no bedroom of my own, zero privacy so no guests, and a space that my bed barely fits in right next to the washer and dryer. The other ""friend"" who lives there doesn't have a job, refuses to find a job, refuses to even apply for food stamps to help out with the food he devours, doesn't clean a damn thing, holds dirty dishes on his side of the backroom (that we share btw), his side can be completely closed off and he can have privacy, they pay for his vape pods, they pay forhis phone, they pay for his clothes, they pay for EVERYTHING of his and he doesn't do a damn thing around the house unless he is specifically asked by them and that's still a 50/50 if he actually does it. He just plays video games all day. Meanwhile I'm paying close to 1000$ a month, doing damn near all the cooking (and I work 6 days a week) and 90$ of the cleaning (especially fucking washing dishes). But heaven forbid if I don't do anything for a day or two and play video games myself and relax. I become public enemy number 1 in the house. Last night it confirmed that I'm only kept around for money purposes. We buy Delta 8 THC cartridges because it's ""legal"" weed here in FL that you don't need a medical card to get, it helps my back and my seizures so a cart lasts me damn near 2 weeks. They will blow through 1 in a single day. And it has turned into them only wanting to hang out with me if I have a cart because they know I won't say no and Wil share with them.

Before you tell me to get my own place, I can't afford it. What I pay them is damn near everything I make and being trans, living in a VERY right-wing area, I don't have anyone I trust to live with and any place I could afford on what I make is too far from my job and I don't have a car (because I can't save up to get one).

Family Relationships? Practically non-existent for me. My father is in ND and was VERY abusive, I am STILL afraid of that man to this day, haven't seen him in over 6 years and he has zero idea that I am transitioning. Dont have to worry about my mother telling him because they HATE each other and the last time they spoke was when I nearly died in a car accident 12 years ago.My mother, we live in the same state but she's never been around, my stepdad and her new family are all that's ever mattered to her, I'm just the disappointment. I'm her oldest and there are still people to this day who think her only kids are my little sister and little brother. She only talks to me when her and my sister are fighting 🤷‍♂️. I have grandparents and aunts and uncles, but again, I'm the tranny freak of the family, and they are all right-wing conservatives, healthy mix of Catholics, Christians, and a handful of Muslims (But my lesbian cousin and lesbian stepsister are perfectly acceptable and well loved by them ALL.)

So, I have nowhere to go, no one to even turn to, no support network. I used to tell myself that my reason for going on was because I still genuinely believed that it was just my depression talking and that people really did love me and care about me. Then when I stopped believing that about my family I started saying that my best and their kids were why I kept going. When that stopped working I said my 2 cats are what keep me going because I love them. Now, I'm at the breaking point where I know that no one will actually miss me, they'll just miss me being their doormat. My cats will be just fine, they aren't going to miss me because let's face it, as much as we anthropomorphize our pets they don't think the way we do and love is really just a human thing. The ONLY reason I'm not dead is because I don't want to inconvenience THEM with having to deal with the hassle of my dead body. That's it. The only reason. Because I'm too much of a broken, mental health ridden person that cares way too fucking much about others who don't give a damn about me that the thought of inconvenience THEM with my death is the only reason I haven't done it. Let's fucking face the music here, everyone will pretend for a whole 3 days that they care and miss me and as soon as my death isn't beneficial to them for sympathy votes they will then completely forget about me and my next of kin will then just be pissed off that they got saddled with handing my corpse. Shit I wouldn't put it past any of them to just have me cremated and then just throw my ashes away. 

And I've tried to change, I've tried to not give a damn about others and think about myself but it makes me sick to my stomach to be that way. I always try to see the good in people and I can't change that about me. I'll always care more for others than myself, but I CAN'T  handle the abuse that comes with that any longer. I just fucking can't anymore. So if I can't change that about myself and I want the abuse to be done with, then leaving the living world is really my only option left.

Pretty sure I've gone on long enough though.

However, I think I'm done. I've felt so lonely for so long that I've just gotten used to it, but I can't ignore it anymore. I'm only 17, I might as well get it over with now because I know it'll get worse if I go to college like I was planning. I hate myself so much and people think I'm weird and antisocial.

the Suicide ending of Cyberpunk 2077 is horrible and I hate that it's there

all the discussions i've seen online keep saying ""oh the game is an anti-suicide message and seeing all the voicemails from your upset friends is a good deter from killing yourself, don't die because people love you uwu"" and like??

no???

like sure, valid take. if the suicide ending helped you out of a shitty time, good for you

but personally, my life was at the most stable it's ever been — and cp2077 plunged me back into suicidal ideation.

now before some jackass comes in and says ""it's CYBERPUNK what do you EXPECT,"" fuck off. I literally had no idea what ""cyberpunk"" even was before the fucking game. Buzz off. (For anyone who doesn't know, it's a genre. Look it up, i cant be bothered to explain. Bleak dystopia yadda yadda)

The long and short of CP2077 is that V, the player character, basically contracts a terminal illness, and the whole game is about them trying to find a cure.

spoiler alert: there is no cure.

the ""point of no return"" in the game, when you can't do side-missions after that point, is a meeting between you and this high-ranking person from a company that could *potentially* cure your disease. After this meeting, you suffer an attack from the terminal illness (coughing fit, vomitting blood and guts, that kinda shit), and your doctor tells you ""hey, you really need to do something about this *now* because if you suffer an attack again you're literally just dead.""

and from there, you're put at the crossroads, all your options laid out before you: who do you go to for help? X friend, Y friend, or the company?

none of the options look good, because if you go to either of your friends, there's the chance of someone dying in their efforts to help you find a cure. and as for the company: well, you could go to them, but the company's shady as fuck and they're known for screwing people over. chances are, they're gonna screw you over too.

so, what now?

the game gives you a fourth option:

kill yourself.

…i did that on my first playthrough. And it sucked. V killed himself, his friends left him voicemails ranging from saddened but accepting, to devestated and understanding, to furious and grieving. nothing about this ending is good.

especially the fact that the game literally said ""Suicide is an option.""

that's why I hate this ending. That's why I don't think it's 100% a good ""anti-suicide"" message. The game didn't say, ""Don't do this,"" the game said, ""This is an option.""

And like… while yeah, I agree — I think, on some level, euthanasia and assisted suicide should be a thing — it's not… I don't think the game handled it well. Because by telling me, ""Yes, suicide is an option,"" it basically handed me a gun and said, ""Yeah. Go kill yourself.""

god i dont know how to articulate it. What I'm trying to say is: suffering suicidal ideation sucks. I *don't* want to be here. I *don't* like the idea of killing myself, of dying. There's a huge difference between \[wanting the shittiness in my life to stop\] and \[wanting to die\]. I want the former, not the latter. The despair— suicidal ideation is *excruciating*, wouldn't fucking wish it upon my worst enemy. I want *nothing more* than to keep living, to solve whatever shitty thing is going on in my life. I *like* living, but that unfortunately gets bogged down by shitty school systems and my country's irreprably corrupt government and my shitty circumstances, my mental illness and etc etc etc, and it all drives me to the point of thinking about jumping out of my goddamn window, and I *hate* that.

And Cyberpunk 2077, in having its player character suffer an incurable disease; in saying that the disease is incurable and V's going to die in six months; in having V - in the ending where he can decide to live out those six months - push away and become distant from his SO and loved ones; in giving the player an option to have V kill himself, it told me, point-blank, ""Yes. Suicide is the only way out of this. There is no hope. *Kill yourself.*""

and i'm sick and fucking tired of everyone saying the suicide ending was ""anti-suicide""

because it was everything but.

&#x200B;

…i wish this game came with a suicide warning.

the game coulda rectified this with having the ""live out the six months"" ending show v spending time with their SO, friends and loved ones, but nooo had to focus on the stupid fucking ""become a legend in night city!!"" bullshit. fuck's sake.

<p>the Suicide ending of Cyberpunk 2077 is horrible and I hate that it&#39;s there</p>

<p>all the discussions i&#39;ve seen online keep saying &quot;oh the game is an anti-suicide message and seeing all the voicemails from your upset friends is a good deter from killing yourself, don&#39;t die because people love you uwu&quot; and like??</p>

<p>no???</p>

<p>like sure, valid take. if the suicide ending helped you out of a shitty time, good for you</p>

<p>but personally, my life was at the most stable it&#39;s ever been — and cp2077 plunged me back into suicidal ideation.</p>

<p>now before some jackass comes in and says &quot;it&#39;s CYBERPUNK what do you EXPECT,&quot; fuck off. I literally had no idea what &quot;cyberpunk&quot; even was before the fucking game. Buzz off. (For anyone who doesn&#39;t know, it&#39;s a genre. Look it up, i cant be bothered to explain. Bleak dystopia yadda yadda)</p>

<p>The long and short of CP2077 is that V, the player character, basically contracts a terminal illness, and the whole game is about them trying to find a cure.</p>

<p>spoiler alert: there is no cure.</p>

<p>the &quot;point of no return&quot; in the game, when you can&#39;t do side-missions after that point, is a meeting between you and this high-ranking person from a company that could <em>potentially</em> cure your disease. After this meeting, you suffer an attack from the terminal illness (coughing fit, vomitting blood and guts, that kinda shit), and your doctor tells you &quot;hey, you really need to do something about this <em>now</em> because if you suffer an attack again you&#39;re literally just dead.&quot;</p>

<p>and from there, you&#39;re put at the crossroads, all your options laid out before you: who do you go to for help? X friend, Y friend, or the company?</p>

<p>none of the options look good, because if you go to either of your friends, there&#39;s the chance of someone dying in their efforts to help you find a cure. and as for the company: well, you could go to them, but the company&#39;s shady as fuck and they&#39;re known for screwing people over. chances are, they&#39;re gonna screw you over too.</p>

<p>so, what now?</p>

<p>Until then, wishing everyone the best in finding the solutions they are looking for and finding good fortune in this coin toss of a world.</p>

I don't know what I did. I'm having a bad day and I guess because I'm not immediately over it I'm not trying hard enough. I have severe anxiety and I guess because I don't ""just do it anyway"" I'm not even trying. My mum's advice is always ""you just have to take a deep breath and do it anyway"" like I haven't tried to do it and had a panic attack. It's not ""oh I'm just a little anxious"", it's fear. And when I do have a panic attack, she just tells me to calm down and stop being dramatic. Does she think I'm doing this on purpose? That I want to feel this way?

I see no point in staying alive. I can't do the most basic things because of my anxiety, and I'm burdening everyone around me. I can't even get help from a doctor because of anxiety. No one is willing to help me make an appointment though. I'm not looking to be coddled and treated like a baby, I just want a little understanding? I just want someone to say ""it's okay to feel this way, I know you don't want to and I know it's hard, and we'll face it when you're ready.""

This last summer was the happiest time of my life. A loving relationship, addiction free and able to see mates all the time (summer after exams). Never felt happier and now I know I will never be that happy again.

Well things have changed. A really tough breakup. Not being able to see people as much. Relapsing. Managed to get through a large bottle of 40% behind the counter booze in two days trying to squash this shit down. I did that even after vowing I would never drink due to my dad's alcoholism and abuse as a child. I feel so alone and as if no one cares. She's moved on from me and for the most part I'm happy for her but I feel discarded and worthless. Like I never meant anything to anyone.

My life means nothing and the people im closest to will be safer and happier without seeing me destroy myself like this. I need to let them live their lives without having me around to bring them down. No one needs me like they used to and I just feel so fucking alone.

This past year has been a mess. I was raped several times over each month for the past few months. My rapist is gone as he passed away. What is sick is he was a family member and I am conflicted because I miss him. I miss the memories and I miss the feeling of him inside. 

I am damaged and I am not good to anyone. I ruin a lot of things because I am so broken. 

I had a roomate who I pushed away because it was easier doing that verses telling him the truth that: he was blackmailing me with him. 

My rapist knew some fucked up things about my roomate and i allowed the abuse because I couldn’t see him get hurt. 

No, I was never in love with my roomie and I never had feelings for him. 

I just cared so much about my best friend that I did my best to protect him. 

How could I explain to him that I continued an arrangement that kept him safe. Out of jail and out of harms way. 

I miss my friend more than anything. I am really alone in a place that has me in terrible memories. 

I hate myself for lying to my bestfriend. I hate myself for my body enjoying what my attacker did. I hate myself for not being able to protect myself the way my roomate wanted me to.

Last summer I finally got medicated and my life has definitely improved. But I'm still basically useless. But that's not even the issue. I'm heart-broken. 

About five years ago, I met the love of my life. The way we met nearly convinced me that fate was real. While I did not become a believer in that, I did become immediately aware that what *is* real is love at first sight. I had never felt the things I felt for him for anyone else. And we were together for 5 years. I loved him every moment and I still do. But I was fucking mess. I couldn't hold down a job (still kind of can't.), and I was a neurotic mess. But I really fucked up when I let my emotions overtake me. I truly thought I would never get better so I tried to end it. I obviously survived. But the love of my life... something changed that day. 

We didn't know it then, but he started to fall out of love with me. And why wouldn't he? He had for *years* stood beside me and I was just going to fucking peace out, just like that? Just abandon him? Even after that, I still didn't immediately find a psychiatrist so I was still a fucking hot mess. To make a long story short (too late) he met someone and they hit it off and are dating. Have been for months now. And, honestly, she's great. And has been...godlike as far as her understanding and patience with me constantly messaging him telling him how much I'm still in love with him and begging him to give us another chance. 

Recently, I had a breakdown and it was decided we couldn't even be friends. Its been like two days and I'm at my wits end and the only thing that people can give me is that *sOmEdAy It'Ll GeT bEtTeR* and that I just have to improve myself and keep busy. 

Where the fuck am I supposed to get that kind of motivation? I fucking **hate** myself. And every time I do anything remotely competent, I'm just filled with self-hate because had I just fucking done it five years ago, I wouldn't have lost him.

But I don’t know how much longer I can hold on with this horrible fucking pain this disease has caused me. Suicidal thoughts are now invading my dreams…I already have a plan if everything fails. Its a shame because I actually have dreams for my life…</p>

My best friend was assaulted by her moms boyfriend. I had to snitch, she got put into a foster home and I tried my best to console her but we both just spiraled from there. 

At 17 I got assaulted in my dorm room. It was nothing compared to the second time at 19. I met him at the first party I went to since I was assaulted- my birthday party. Check post history for details - I can’t go through it again.

This past month I’ve been remembering more and more details. I didn’t realize how much of it I repressed but it’s been starting to come back. The event is all I can think about from the time I wake up until I pass out (because there is no such thing as sleep now). I am remembering more and more details and I just need to turn my brain off. I just want peace. 

I have already bought my supplies and I am genuinely ready to kill myself. I can only think of a few times and my attempt at 15 when I was close to this serious. 

I’m scared about what I might do. My husband is going to cry himself to sleep at night so is my mom and baby brother. But I don’t deserve this and I can’t keep existing like this. I smoke I drink I’m trying not to SH (scared that I may “accidentally” go to far like I have before). I don’t know what else I can do to cope.

I told him to stop and I didn’t want to. And he told me to “Shh” then I heard a small noise and saw a condom wrapper fall onto the bed he was holding me down on. 

I was in therapy for a year before meeting him. He assaulted me two days before the second the last session and I lied through my teeth and my last session. Everyone talked about their progress and how proud we were of one another. And I just made up an excuse and cried while I walked back to my dorm. 

I am sorry to get so graphic but I haven’t thought about these memories in years. And every little lapse in conversation or commercial break it is all I can think about.

* I almost failed my backup twice because of the same disease
* I've been trying to get stable remote job for a full 8 months now because job on the area of my study here doesn't pay well
* failed miserably, even when people are enthusiastic in hiring me, they back up then because of the financial hassle of doing business with my country 
* Lost my very close uncle who was like a second father for me last year
* Lost my a beloved aunt too last year
* And then lost another uncle I had very strong bond with this year
* Almost lost my mother in April

2048.0,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x00000184EBEFAFD0>,,SuicideWatch,"I've been feeling so awful about myself lately. I keep comparing myself (M) to this girl in my class who I  feel like is just doing everything better than I am. I would say that I'm a pretty good student (I currently have a 4.0 in our major, although it won't stay that way after this semester), but she's just \*better\*. She manages her time better, she understands the material better, and to be perfectly frank, I think she's just smarter than I am. 

Even with all the effort we both put into school though, she also does more outside of class too. She has a wider social circle, spends more time going out, and I just keep wondering, what the hell have I been doing for the past 3 years of university?

I know, I know, ""compare and despair"" and all that. But I can't help it. It doesn't matter how much I remind myself that everyone has their unique differences and strengths, I just cannot stop envying her. 

She's a fun person to be around to be honest. At one point, I even tried asking her out, but she already has a partner. It hurts to be let down like that, even though she was honestly incredibly nice/understanding about it. 

And now there's just so much fucking stuff to do for class and university and all that. I'm so burnt out and I'm so tired and I really just want to finish my degree. Make no mistake, she seems stressed too, but she's worried about working on stuff that's not even due until Friday of next week. I know I'm a complete hypocrite for thinking this, but holy shit dude like you're doing so well why are you even worried. It's the exact same spiel I've heard said to me and now I get why.

This shouldn't make me want to kill myself. If I was going to feel this way over everyone who I think is doing better than me I would have killed myself a long time ago. But I feel like this is different. She seems like an alternate version of me where I made better decisions, wasted less of my life on video games, and people actually liked me. It's one thing to see someone living a better life when they have had a completely different experience than you. It's another when you can relate to them so much and yet they are still doing so much better. 

You know what makes this even worse? This isn't even the first time I feel like this has happened to me. In high school I feel like I underwent a similar experience. I liked a girl and confessed my feelings to her, but she didn't reciprocate. At the same time, school was getting a lot more stressful and things just kept piling up.  I don't think the envy aspect was really there, so I guess that part is different, but the feelings of inadequacy definitely were. Anyways, I got depressed and eventually I just fell into this state of complete apathy. It culminated in an incompetently executed suicide attempt which really shook up my life for a while.

We haven't gotten to that last part yet. And really, \*I don't want to\*, but every other option feels like it keeps making things worse not better. Or maybe I'll feel better briefly and then it just comes back worse the next week. 

But even though I know I'm just being irrational, I still feel awful. I feel like I want to give up. Being aware of this isn't saving me or even making it easier to cope. I don't even know how anyone could even help me at this point. I'm not even sure what I think I'm accomplishing by posting this.

If someone offered me the option to forget ever meeting this girl, I'm not sure how I would respond. I'm honestly so frustrated that I waste so much time still thinking about her. It's not productive and it just makes me feel bad. On the other hand though, I'd like to think we are friends at this point. It's nice to talk to someone you have a lot in common with. 

I've been told by someone before that my success with school work made them feel terrible. I wonder how similar this situation is to how he's feeling. Over the weekend, I talked to another classmate of mine who was in the year below mine about grades and such and they looked so disheartened when I told them I had a 4.0. She said she was probably going to get a B or even a C this semester and I think she was really suffering with her classes. I should have lied, honestly. Maybe other people handle it better than I do, but I don't like the thought of making people feel this way. Even at the time, I was trying to not make her feel bad, but I wasn't doing a very good job.

What are you even supposed to say? Don't worry no one cares about GPA after you graduate? True, but \*I\* care, and she probably does too. It's not always about the practical part.

I've already attempted many times and have been hospitalized.

I'm a ""minority"" in the US in every sense of the word, and I came out as trans/non-binary last year. I can't really do anything about it. Transitioning isn't an option for me, financially speaking, and just generally afraid of medical procedures. So it's pretty much over for me.

I come from a very traditional family, and they are not accepting. Not in a way that is violent, but more belittling. I dress in a way where I ""pass"" as my preferred gender, and my peers generally are accepting of that, but...

Separate from that, I'm Bipolar II and just an all-around headcase. General traumas that I will not bore anyone with. I can't really hold down a regular job because I either quit a month in or stop showing up. I have exaggerated issues with getting out of bed or plain waking up. I freelance as an artist and do the bare minimum work and barely make ends meet.

I have been medicated on and off for over a decade and reacted terribly to all of them. To combat lethargy, suicidality, and exhaustion, I'd be put on medications. Psychotic episodes tended to happen after I started taking the medications. I've probably been on any SSRI you name. Paxil, Zoloft, Celexa, Lexapro, Wellbutrin, Effexor.

I'm not on anything right on, so we're back to the suicidality and lethargy. Which is about 100x better than being psychotic. Psychotic makes you destroy people and things. Lately, the only thing that helps is me buying Xanax and Ketamine and whatever drugs from a drug dealer every month and taking it the minute I have a suicidal urge (more than a thought) which is about three times a week.

I'm definitely going out this way. There's no way around it. I've known since I was a kid that I'm just not cut out for this life, but people keep insisting that I stick around. It has never been temporary.

Long story sort went to uni, gets cheated on by my girl, i get depression/anxiety, covid kicks in, fail school, grandma gets alzheimer, only me and my mom is there for her, my two older siblings are drug addicts. Fast forward 3 months grandma gets admitted to hospital, i finally start therapy and 2 weeks in grandma dies. 

Failing school, but atleast in therapy. Meanwhile i am having double vision, so finally go to a neurologist. Find out my kidneys are failing, and i need to have surgery on them. I also get very sick, cant stand up without passing out, dizzy all the time. Therapy ends abruptly, it ended really badly. while i have to go from doctor to doctor. But atleast get a little hope that it will be over soon, get an appointment for kidney surgery, finally i go back to school feeling better.

Get surgery. Nothing improves, and now i feel even worse. Now i went to a few other doctors, got some blood works done and i might have fucking Thymus cancer. Fuck. My. Life.


Cant believe it. Now suicidal thoughts are going on 24/7. Even In my dreams i just cry, and feel anxiety all the time. I cant help it. Im failing school again. I think about hanging my self all the time, and now its a pleasing thought not a scary one. I cant go back to therapy because how it ended, i feel like my therapist just screwed therapy for me.

I turned to alcohol and cigarettes lately but even those cant put this pain out. I cant do sports which i loved because im too weak. I used to do them 7 times a week but i cant even stand up these days because im too sick.  No friends, bad relationship with family, have no one to turn too,  afraid to talk to others.

It feels like this is hopeless. I dont want to be such a f*ing failiure anymore, i cant even finish uni. I watched 3 different classes of people go through it and i failed three times and going to fail again. 

I cant even be healthy, i'm so fucked up its a miracle im still alive.

<p>As i wrote this down i realised how incoherrent it is so TLDR:
Bad family, brother abused me, parents abused me. Got a girlfriend while in school. First love, spend every time with her. but she cheated
Got depressed, grandma alzheimer, dies, therapy, therapy ends badly, , Lose all friends because one of them called me bad names because i stood up for someone he bullied so no friends.Failing uni still in second year although im there 4 years already. failing kidney than now chance of cancer.

I’m just stream of consciousness-ing this either as a record of my thoughts for closure if I follow through or a way to put my thoughts to paper so to speak.

I’m 23 years old. I’m a Native American/Caucasian male, I was born out of wedlock and my parents are addicts. My whole life I’ve been stuck in someone’s crisis, either of my own making or someone close to me. I had a pretty rough early childhood and am thankful for the help I got from the family that were around and stable at the time. Formative years were pretty chill until 2008. My family lost their house, my step dad got laid off, and we lost everything.  I moved to Utah and lived with my grandparents for a couple of years. When I was 14, my parents finally got their feet under them and we moved out of their place and into a house in the city. I was ostracized for not fitting the mold in middle and high school. I found my people with the punks and skaters and stoners. I started doing drugs and partying when I was 15, just weed and alcohol for a while, but it grew to prescription pills, cocaine, and dealing. I got locked up at 17 for a trafficking case and did 9 months. 

When I got out, I met a girl. We clicked and formed a solid friendship, but there was always sexual undertones. After I got off probation, we smoked weed one night and hooked up. We didn’t have penetrative sex, but we did have oral and digital sex. It turns out she had a boyfriend. Her boyfriend grilled her on where the marks came from and what she was doing last night. She made up a story about going to a party and I raped her. She did everything in her power to not press charges, but her bf reported me and her parents got involved. I was barely 18, she was 9 months younger than me. Age of consent in my state is 16, but the detectives who took my case were the same detectives who tried on 3 occasions to get me tried as an adult when I was a minor.

They gave me a charge called Object Rape of a Minor. It carries a federal minimum 15 year sentence and a maximum sentence of life in prison, lifetime sex offender registry.

I paid $50,000 for a trial lawyer and the case stagnated for 4 years. I fell out with drugs again. I drank every day and did a half ounce of coke a day for 3 years. Unfortunately, I didn’t die. As this was going on, #MeToo swept the nation. Over the course of this case, the court of public opinion changed their bearing on sexual abuse.

I ended up pleading out on sex abuse because they offered me no jail time snd 10 year registry instead of the severe consequences associated with the Original charge. I never got my day in court and waived my right to ever defend myself in an attempt to preserve my best opportunity at living a life worth living.

I got sober. I put my suit on and went to the courthouse. I gave the most sincere apology I could muster, made a promise to myself, the honorable judge, my victim, and all those at the court to witness that day that I would use this opportunity to be a better person and live a good life. I had a great job as a manager for a local, beloved restaurant franchise. I was sent out and I felt relief like I’ve never felt in my life.

Since the weeks prior to my court date in March of 2020, I’ve been sober. I’ve excelled at work. I’ve repaired relationships with friends and family and followed through on my promise and probation. I’ve gotten treatment, I’ve paid my restitution, I’ve fixed my credit, I’ve made a man out of myself. A man I was proud to be. I was happy to be in my own skin for the first time in my life.

Then last November…November 2, 2020, my sister died suddenly of COVID. Two weeks later, Earl died. He was the only one who came to my court case. All he wanted was for me to do well. My dad died shortly after. I got a cat to cope and I loved that cat with all the love I didn’t get to give to people who were gone too soon. Then the cat got multiple cancers and died too.

My lease ran up in July. I cant rent because of my situation. I couldn’t find a place to live and was homeless for 45 days. I finally got a basement apartment but that’s coming to an end next months because they ran my background.

The one thing that’s been solid is my job. My boss is a good friend and has screened for me, protecting me. I have been promoted 4 times. I fired an assistant manager for ethical concerns. She ran my background snd sent it to the owner.

I was forced to resign today. I literally put an offer in on a house yesterday.

Everything is fucking ruined and I’m going to be homeless and I’ll never get hired anywhere with my background.

I’m fucking worthless and no matter how good I do, no matter how much I excel, no matter how much I outperform my peers, I will always be marked and I will never get to live a life without being fearful for any interactions I have with people. Everyone has leverage on me.

To get started Sorry about the joke, weather its by instinct, I text and chat and often include random jokes in each response on a conversation. Wether to a playful jokes, awkward jokes, or outright distasteful jokes alongside a chuckle to myself. I guess to start off of introduction, My demons always lived within me since 3 forced in the US from a divorce, language barrier was always there to later thinning at the cost of losing my own sense of culture and language disconnected from both sides as I grew older. Later I was forced in Spanish alongside english development learning, I got laughed at for my speech impediment, embarrassed, ran away, bit my ELD teacher, later to being cradled as a 3ft 10 in 4th grade.

To sum it all up My life was always ridiculed, I’m now 21 and all I fantasize yet feared was succumbing myself in a dark room as if I fallen asleep yet I feared of being alone if death becomes just a dark room. And everyday I always felt encouraged to step in and end it. Lately I lost track of time, I haven’t slept healthy or maybe I haven’t been healthy, I sleep less to sleep too much to ending myself in sleep deprivation later to dousing sleeping pills degenerating myself into drinking cans of beer which turned into hard liquor just so I can have the sense of drowsiness. the nicotine keeps coming back to my system mentally involuntarily as I feel disconnected within my own body, I always feel envious towards the people who made dreams of their own aspirations when I cant but just fantasize about my death, I always hid my true intentions of myself as I experienced with my family what felt to me as a waste of budget or felt threaten to go to a mental hospital to be label as crazy or dramatic when I have all the things them younger selves would be envious of so I jokingly call myself lazy, having a hang loose demeanor when I’m hanging by a thread. The future to me seems empty, I lie to myself daily, and for a land of opportunities, opportunities seems to be beyond my grasp. idk what to do or even say, I always wanted to be alone but in reality it doesn’t make sense to me when I feel overwhelming sense of loss when I tell my friends/family a simple “goodbye” when they want to move to another state/country, Wether selfish I instead say “see you later” when knowingly the string detached overtime.

2048.0,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x00000184EBEFAFD0>,,SuicideWatch,"Greetings, this is my first time posting, after typing this i had no idea how much of a wall of text it would be, read if you wish...

I am a 26-year old male, avg. height, I've been working out for the past few years so I'm in a good physical condition and I'm nearly done with my master's degree. But there is a very pathetic and dark thing about me... Do you know that feeling when you really like someone so you finally mass up the courage to ask her/him out and they say yes so you're filled with this joy, happiness and relief because they like you back? In 26 years I have never had a girl like me. I have never had sex, I've never kissed, I've never held a girl's hand and I've never cuddled, rarely ever have I got a girl reply to my messages but it never got any further than communicating through messages. - fucking pathetic, I know. Recently I met this girl, I liked her a lot but she had a boyfriend so I suppressed it, a few days after hanging out her boyfriend broke up with her, this hurt her really bad and all I wanted was to make sure she is okay so I let our mutual friends know whenever she was sad and alone so they could do something about it, it seemed to do the trick as she would cheer up after talking to them. On top of that I think she really enjoyed talking to me, whenever I smiled at her she smiled back, she was always trying to be as close to me as possible, she was always butting into conversations I had with other people, I never minded any of that, I liked her a lot so it felt really good to have her next to me. Have in mind this was a 2-week work related trip so when I got home I asked one of our mutual friends if it was appropriate to message her, he told me I should give it a go and I did, we chatted for a week and then met in person on a hang-out with our mutual friends. After that hang-out I decided I had to let her know how I felt as for the first time in my life I actually believed I might be liked back... Surprise, surprise it went exactly as I had truly expected, a rejection, again, she says she is simply not ready for anything new yet and that she values our friendship - rejected and friendzoned... again... I suppose she just wanted to feel good and flirting with me made her feel better, no one cares that it completely destroyed my soul for what I think was the last time. Now I've been rejected many times but this time it somehow just felt different as if something just broke inside me, as if it dawned on me that I would really never feel what it is like to have your feelings returned, possibly because I allowed myself to actually feel hope for the first time in a long time, possibly because it is not about the girl herself but more of the idea that I am not worthy of love. At this point I do not even want to meet a girl that likes me, a girl that would allow herself to be liked by me is a lot more than I can hope for... I suppose that was the drop that overfilled the cup, I have been depressed for a long time and I can say I never liked my life but I was never suicidal, I fear this has changed. This soul crushing loneliness I've been feeling for so long just festered deep inside me and it feels like that blister of everything bad I've felt in the past 10 years finally burst. I can no longer sleep for more than 5 hours a night, I no longer have appetite so I've started losing muscle, the only thing I can think of is this so I can not fulfill my work obligations properly, my health started declining, I no longer enjoy anything I used to, I haven't cried since I was a child but for the past week and a half I have been crying every day...

<p>I am a 26-year old male, avg. height, I&#39;ve been working out for the past few years so I&#39;m in a good physical condition and I&#39;m nearly done with my master&#39;s degree. But there is a very pathetic and dark thing about me... Do you know that feeling when you really like someone so you finally mass up the courage to ask her/him out and they say yes so you&#39;re filled with this joy, happiness and relief because they like you back? In 26 years I have never had a girl like me. I have never had sex, I&#39;ve never kissed, I&#39;ve never held a girl&#39;s hand and I&#39;ve never cuddled, rarely ever have I got a girl reply to my messages but it never got any further than communicating through messages. - fucking pathetic, I know. Recently I met this girl, I liked her a lot but she had a boyfriend so I suppressed it, a few days after hanging out her boyfriend broke up with her, this hurt her really bad and all I wanted was to make sure she is okay so I let our mutual friends know whenever she was sad and alone so they could do something about it, it seemed to do the trick as she would cheer up after talking to them. On top of that I think she really enjoyed talking to me, whenever I smiled at her she smiled back, she was always trying to be as close to me as possible, she was always butting into conversations I had with other people, I never minded any of that, I liked her a lot so it felt really good to have her next to me. Have in mind this was a 2-week work related trip so when I got home I asked one of our mutual friends if it was appropriate to message her, he told me I should give it a go and I did, we chatted for a week and then met in person on a hang-out with our mutual friends. After that hang-out I decided I had to let her know how I felt as for the first time in my life I actually believed I might be liked back... Surprise, surprise it went exactly as I had truly expected, a rejection, again, she says she is simply not ready for anything new yet and that she values our friendship - rejected and friendzoned... again... I suppose she just wanted to feel good and flirting with me made her feel better, no one cares that it completely destroyed my soul for what I think was the last time. Now I&#39;ve been rejected many times but this time it somehow just felt different as if something just broke inside me, as if it dawned on me that I would really never feel what it is like to have your feelings returned, possibly because I allowed myself to actually feel hope for the first time in a long time, possibly because it is not about the girl herself but more of the idea that I am not worthy of love. At this point I do not even want to meet a girl that likes me, a girl that would allow herself to be liked by me is a lot more than I can hope for... I suppose that was the drop that overfilled the cup, I have been depressed for a long time and I can say I never liked my life but I was never suicidal, I fear this has changed. This soul crushing loneliness I&#39;ve been feeling for so long just festered deep inside me and it feels like that blister of everything bad I&#39;ve felt in the past 10 years finally burst. I can no longer sleep for more than 5 hours a night, I no longer have appetite so I&#39;ve started losing muscle, the only thing I can think of is this so I can not fulfill my work obligations properly, my health started declining, I no longer enjoy anything I used to, I haven&#39;t cried since I was a child but for the past week and a half I have been crying every day... On top of all this, my father is an alcoholic, he isn&#39;t abusive but he is a drunk and it takes a toll on your family, he had been sober for 6 months (which is the first time I had seen him sober since I can remember) and two weeks ago he started drinking again with this taking a heavy toll on my mother and sister.

Ive tried medicine

Ive tried therapy

Ive tried everything that i thought was possbile

I want to experience the ancient ritual.

People have told me that i may appreciate life more after the ayahuasca. 

Maybe i will

Maybe i wont

If i dont and i somehow come out of the ceremony realizing i hate life even more than i did before my ""awakening"" then i will be walking myself off the cliff where i go for the ceremony.

I am no longer scared of disappointing my family, friends, and girl friend.

Had made a definitive decision and agreement with myself that I wouldn’t do it some years ago, but I’ve still had episodes where I have greatly desired to. I can usually pull myself out of it though. Learned about having Add/ocd/cptsd, have worked really hard to work through, been ok with the “non-linear” healing journey but it’s still been very tough at times. 

The last 2 years have been rough and in the last 6 months I’ve experienced traumatic job loss with some majorly hurtful relational betrayals from people I’ known for 6+ years I thought I was close to  (plus one person that came into my life as a “friend,” love bombed me, inserted themselves deeply into my personal life then ghosted me), have been socially isolated from my day-to-day social outlet, unexplained illness (+ loss of health insurance) that left me feeling pretty shitty and exhausted on the average day, I couldn’t eat regularly until very recently but am still the lightest I’ve ever weighed since I was 14, and I now have complete disinterest if not utter disgust with my field of work that used to one of my most driving passions and sources of motivation.  I’ve been overwhelmed by the flood of mental health issues coming at me from all sides during this time and I’ve officially become penniless as of a few weeks ago. It’s so hard to do anything aside from get up and move to the couch. Been doing so much job searching but so much makes me feel unqualified or angry or just empty inside. Plus so much mental fog.

A couple months back I made a post in r/SuicideWatch  that I was going to attempt by taking fentanyl laced pills. Well, I did. I ate 10. strong ones, too. Somehow, despite only weighing 125 pounds and having no opiate tolerance, I was found alive 14 hours later and rushed to the ER where they hit me with Narcan to reverse the overdose and I stayed overnight. The next day I was transferred to psych hospital for a week. This was all in September.

Overall..
Am I happy I lived?
I don't know yet. At first, no. And now it's still not yes, but it isn't completely no. I've had support from family and friends throughout which has been wonderful. But, I had my mind made up on it, finally did it, and it was taken from me. I don't blame my family for saving me (I was angry at first) but I would've done the same in their position.

is there a white light situation? not that i saw at that point. i wasn't dead, but i was damn close. was on oxygen my entire time in the ER because mine was dropping dangerously low. ive been told to be thankful i lived because it was close. but i'm still working on that.

initially I planned to try again. but now i'm just kinda riding this wave and see what happens going forward. never know what's coming next. seeing your family hurt sucks. but so does feeling this way.

but is it true you regret it immediately?
upon first swallowing the pills, I had about a 30 second ""holy shit i did that"" period, followed by the most relieved feeling ive ever had, like it was finally about to end. i never at any point got to feel the pills, i was asleep within 45 minutes of taking them.

If you try to do things, you'll *definitely* be apathetic or overwhelmed and I won't let you finish them. Don't even try.""

I'm 24 years old and I still live with my parents. I moved back in with them after college. It was supposed to be temporary, but it's been two years. They're out of town and this weekend has been hell. I didn't realize that I can't be alone without wanting to destroy myself--I mean, I knew, but it was never this bad when I was living alone in college. I haven't felt this close to death in my life, and I've lost track of how many times I've attempted. I tried drinking a shit ton of cough syrup last night which was stupid because I knew it would just make me dissociate really hard and feel like shit. I was secretly hoping it would fuck up my organs or heart or something. I don't know what I was thinking. 

I hide my depression well and I've been hiding it a lot lately. People are always surprised when I say I have depression and an anxiety disorder. I know how to mask it, I guess.

I used to be good at things. I graduated college with a 3.9 GPA and planned on going to grad school right after college, but depression and drugs got the best of me and I just...didn't. I used to write songs. They were pretty good for being written by a depressed gay teenager. I even released a few EPs. I used to write poetry; it used to be one of my favorite things to do. I even bought a typewriter for it. I used to draw and paint and I wasn't bad at it. I used to play a lot of different instruments (seven or eight, depending on your definition of ""play"") and now I can barely pick up my guitar.

I used to be creative even when I was depressed, but now I feel nothing. There's no joy in creating or trying. Even when I try, it's unbearable. I've read self-help books for getting creativity back. I've gotten high and sat down with crayons and paper to try and get back some sort of child-like spark. I've tried everything, and it's just gone. 

AND
people in my life keep asking, ""When are you going to do xyz again? You're so good at xyz. I love [piece of media you put out]."" I'm sick of it.

I know I have potential, and it mocks me every day. It's like having my dream car on the driveway. but I have no gas for it, and no way of getting gas. I know it's there; I can't drive it, and I need it to live. I feel like an absolute shell without creativity and I might as well be dead without it. Meanwhile, everyone is like, ""Drive the car!

WHEN THERE'S NO FUCKING GAS IN THE TANK! Like damn, if you wanna pay for therapy and meds for me, then I'll release some great artistic stuff for you to hold in your grubby little hands, but right now? Not happening.

I think I would like to know that at least someone understands what I'm saying. My experience in openness about this is erasure. I truly hope I don't come off as being dramatic. What I'm saying is coming directly out of what I feel.

Everything that happened to me, and is happening to me went under the radar. No one really knows me. It is impossible to really know someone, but, crucial is that in my life, most people, the important people, have not made the intent to get to know me.

Let me start by saying that I want to live. I actually, genuinely think, there is some peace for me to be found, maybe some happiness, maybe even love (though I think the more we evolve throughout generations love will disappear, we are becoming a delusional species when it comes to love, we don't know what is real and we don't know what it means to have genuine, authentic relationships that are about love and not control and fear, neurotic searching for conformation, filling up a hole.) We might know right now, but we will forget.

I don't think I am able to live. I've lived unconsciously for a while. I lived on autopilot. I lived in a performance mode that I was raised into by parents. They never taught me how to trust others, love others, love myself. In fact, what my mother did is teach me to erase myself, force me to erase myself. If I were a bird, she clipped my wings. If I were a small tree, a sapling, she cut me at the trunk. So I would forever be small, under control, and lonely. I was deprived of love. And I forgive her for it.

She never learned how to love herself, her world deprived her of that, stole that from her, and so it is not her fault that she could not give it to me. She did to me what was done to her.

In a heated conversation and a very desperate moment that I was forced into, by erasure (it is a recurring theme), it feels almost like I have no free will -I realized this last night-, I cried to my father that I was born into this world out of fear, not out of love, and that this is why I was never raised to be a person existing in the world, but someone that would always be scared, and wanting to escape. My father is emotionally unaware, he does not know why he is here, he is living out of fear, surviving. There is a need to be liked, to be approved, a dance of unmet needs that he dances with his partners, a filling of a hole in himself and a terrifying fear of being left. I asked him, why he became a father, and he told me, 'out of his love for my mother.'

The problem is that he is not lying. He simply does not know what any of it means. IT is fear, but he refers to it as love. And I can never get through to him. And this is my problem.

There is no one that can care for me that understands my reality. Or at least accepts my reality.

Objectively in life I am finally in the place where (it feels like) I always should have been. I fought my way to university but now that I am there I still constantly feel the need to escape. I feel like I genuinely have something to give, something to contribute. That there might be someone out there that I can help. But to do that I need to grow first as a person. As a self. No one taught me how to live, which is why I've always had to fight with myself just to exist. Which is why I have to fight myself to show up at university, to show up in my friendships, to build a life, and it doesn't work. I can't ever force myself into loving myself. And no matter how hard I try, I cannot learn to live out of love (I know this sounds so cheesy but I just don't have any other words for it) in a vacuum. I need someone for that, and there is no one that can teach me in the way I need to be taught to be able to exist in this world in way were I can feel peace. I think this is the point where people say 'you make it with what you get in life' and I simply did not get enough. Not enough love.

And what makes it so hard is that I see how much people like me. And I can fucking understand why, and it hurts. I'm funny. But I can only love myself in a vacuum. Not with other people. It is not love. It is me loving myself through the eyes of others (Fiona apple quote 'I only like the way I look when looking through your eyes' - I hope no one I know is on this subreddit) and now that I am aware that I do this, I can no longer do it.

So, I can see that people like me, but I do not have enough of myself to really, really trust others. Sooner or later I will want to escape. Because being with most other people will just deprive me of my peace. It will deprive of my loneliness without providing me with company, because I cannot accept the company. It will put me into a state of fear, a state of panic. I will feel unsafe. And eventually I will be the 'I'll disappear if you want me to' needy kind of person. Which is not who I am. But I force myself to be because I cannot keep up being myself forever. I become a facade.  It takes everything I have and more to be able to exist like the person that I am around other people. When I become the facade, through what I call just being dysfunctional (some people don't like the term but what else do I call it. It is dysfunctional in the perspective of the world as it is, In the perspective of evolution.) People will no longer like me (!important) because it is not authentic, it is not real, and I will never create friendships out of that. I refer to this state as a performance, one that makes me feel I'll be discovered in my fakery and fraud at any minute.

All the work I have done on myself in the last three years have lead me back to myself. It has lead me back to my intuition, to what I know but had suppressed. I've spent all this time ignoring it, and escaping it. I was trying to escape my life, but to see that, I had to stop escaping myself first. So I stopped escaping myself. I stopped escaping through Netflix. I stopped escaping through partying. I stopped escaping through my appearance. I stopped escaping through boyfriends. I stopped escaping through self indulgence. I stopped escaping through drugs. I stopped escaping through walks alone in nature. I let go of all of these things, escapes. I am finally meeting myself, now that I am no longer escaping. Even though the need to escape still pulling on me.

I see now that to become truly happy while existing in the world I need to change fundamentally. I need to be able to trust others and I want this so badly.

Since my parents broke my trust, (or never taught me), and I cannot teach myself to trust on my own, I feel doomed. There is no person I can ask to teach me how to trust. It will be nearly impossible to do this without falling into a hole of codependency, and the shitty delusional relationships that most people are in, the kind where they slowly but surely start living in an illusion, which I know will happen to me eventually as well if I try because I have experienced it before. I will betray myself, the facade will show up, it is only a matter of time.

To learn how to trust I need someone to love me unconditionally. I can learn to love myself unconditionally, but this won't solve my problem of being unable to exist in the world. Because I will need to be completely alone to do it. I've done it, but it kills me, because I have to deprive myself of love the moment that I step out to into the world again. It is like the world is calling me to be inauthentic and scared. Existing in the world the way in which I'm doing it right now kills me as well. I will spend a few days in the city where I study and crash at a classmates house, and the longer I am not alone, the more I feel like I'm dying, like I am being crushed physically.

Right now I am living with my father and stepmom, and I often get the same sense I get whenever I am away for while. Something inside of me tells me; ' they are killing me'. Slowly but surely, bit by bit, I am being erased, and blamed for disappearing. I asked my stepmom if she can let me exist. I do not bother her. but she can't. Because she is not living in love. She is living in fear and control, and I am not under her control. (someone with a healthy sense of self, enough love and trust in themselves might be able to live with her without betraying themselves, without giving her control over themselves, but I did not have enough of that in the first place). I have thought about what I need from her, and I truly think that all I need is to just be able to exist, but to be able to exist as a person I need to be surrounded by other people that are authentically themselves in a loving way.

In this place, this reality with my father and my stepmom I cannot just exist. I cannot learn how to trust and how to love, because in order for her to love me, and leave me be, accept me, I need to be a different person. She wants me to be fixed and functioning before she accepts me. And I doubt she will accept me then, because it is not love. What she searches for is to be surrounded with people that she can love herself through, praise herself through. And I forgive her for it.

Because it is what she learned. She was deprived of her own trust. She needs to have control to exist. Control that goes beyond other peoples boundaries. Control that causes her to erase other people, so she feels safe in existing. Because everything is a threat, that needs to be dealt with. She knows that this is who she is, she is fully aware, but she will never be able to speak about it, because then she will lose control. So she lies to herself about who she is. As she lies to herself about her resentment for me. If she would admit to it, she will think she is a bad person, and be ashamed. I want to tell her that it am not angry, I am not disappointed (I kind of am), that she is not a bad person, because I see her beyond her facade of control. But I cannot tell her, because she will hear the words, she will listen, but not hear what I am saying. We are living in two separate worlds. We don't exist in the same reality.

My father is being controlled, but he doesn't know it, and he will not ever come to a point where he can see it. I have tried many times to talk to him, to hope that he will become aware of his patterns, but I'm met with defensiveness, and twisting around, blaming even. And I forgive him for it. I am not angry with him. I am just trying to seek a solution but it all feels very out of reach. My father cannot teach me how to love and trust because he does not know what it is either. He is a man on autopilot, a gardener gardening some plants but he has no idea why he is a gardener, how gardening even works, or that a plant needs water. He provides, yes. He is a friendly man, yes. He is objectively charming, yes. He wears expensive clothes and has a mega shoe collection, yes. He gives me gifts that make my life easier for which I am very thankful, yes. But is there emotional depth? no. Is there anything that means anything in what he says to me? no. Is there just a large pool of empty nothingness behind this facade of succes? yes. He mirrors me in conversations we have. He seeks for my approval. And it erases me (again, I can barely grasp the fact that I still exist after being erased so much). It minimizes me to nothing, because he sees the bare minimum of who I am. He is not interested in who I am or getting to know me, or teaching me anything about the world or how to exist. He just needs to keep his head above water. He needs my stepmother to see that he is putting in effort so that he can get her approval. When I am myself in the conversations that we have -because he convinces himself we have these conversations to get to know each other and talk through what happened in the past- to a point where he cannot feel approved, he switches in his personality. He feels threatened and intimidated. And what I say to him feels like an attack, regardless of the way in which I tell him. And when I see his face it is like I almost cannot recognize him. It is scary, kind of like that [uncanny valley](https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-the-uncanny-valley-4846247) effect. A thought comes up that I try to push and shove away. 'He is not human'. But then I think. maybe he is just too human. Or he is just a human way too adapted to the world. Because the world has asked him to do this. The world forced him to be this way. He let go of his own free will.

I cannot ask my father and stepmother to change. All I can do is ask to them to accept me like a human being, along with my sadness and at this point in my life not very objectively successfully existing. But asking that, is asking them to change. Because they are unable to accept me and my existence being the people that they are. They need me to change before they accept me (mainly my stepmom, my father doesn't really care what I do, to him I actually don't really exist, because he doesn't know me, and is unable to get to know me because he is only keeping his head above water, it's his way of existing. it's almost like he doesn't have any emotions, which he does have of course, but he doesn't know what any of it means and he just suppresses and suppresses and he will never stop doing that. I think the only emotions he really feels are threat, and safety, and I, am a threat. (to his reality, what he believes about himself, because I disagree (I'm not forcing my reality upon him thought, but me just living in another reality in his reality is enough to feel threatened) ) and even then I don't think I can exist, because it is not about me changing for the better or being objectively successful (even though she probably tells herself this), it is about her having control over her own reality, in which I'm existing, because it is how life played out. It is an outcome of decisions her and my father made, in which I am a passive object. And I feel stuck. And then again, I feel the need to escape. Both escape the situation, life, but more than that myself. I am trying to escape my stepmother, my father, their reality, myself as the person they are forcing me to be. (I feel so much like a stereotype I start to feel ashamed even though I know I am not this person and it is the circumstances that are forcing me to be this way.)

I try to escape to a place where my I can exist in my own reality and it is pretty much nowhere to be found.

Because I cannot exist where I am right now, or grow where I am right now to a point where I am strong enough as a person, I feel stuck. I cannot exist in the world as the person that I am, because eventually my body will give up, my brain and body don't work together at all in that sense, and so I feel stuck.

My critical analytical thinking big brain skills have lead me to three possibilities.

1. Exist in the world as is: Does not work, I will feel unhappy and I will want to escape. And eventually I will collapse because I get burned out. I will also not build any true friendships or relationships because I'll be inauthentic.
2. Change to exist in the world: I don't know how. I need someone to teach me how to change. I cannot ask my father, stepmother or mother. I've had a bunch of therapists but the problem is that I get medicalized, or what I feel is medicalized, and needs to be fixed. A therapist cannot teach me what I need to learn. It is something that I needed to learn when I was a child, and this was unsuccessful. I also feel that now that I've reached this point where I am no longer escaping, therapy for some reason no longer works. It's almost like therapy is there to help you to stop escaping yourself, see who you are, see your patterns, by working on it. And now that I know the full extent of my patters and that I can see who I am, it's like my therapist is just mirroring my self-reflectiveness. Because I'm self aware enough (I hope haha). I show my self reflectiveness and it is reflected back on to me. And I don't an awful lot from that, nor progress in who I am and want to be. I've also tried EMDR, to deal with some trauma's that my mother instilled in me, which helped, but it's not enough for me to change. It's not that I have been damaged. It is that I was deprived of something. I don't think therapy can heal that. I need a person to teach me. But it is impossible for me to ask that of someone. Also because no matter how much I want to, I feel like I can't get to a point where I let others help me.
3. Be forever alone: I will not be happy. Because some day sooner or later I will lose all my value in society, I will be old and unattractive, and alone, without money most likely because I would live an alone life, and it will no longer be a choice. Part of the peace that comes with choosing to be alone is the lie I tell myself that I could still have a life with other people. It is what happens now as well whenever I am alone. Peace comes over me, but part of that peace stems from imagining scenario's of the amazing live I could live, that I struggle so hard to make real.

Some part of my struggle is also existential (yeah). Even if I were to fix myself and be able to exist in the world. This world is not made for living. It is made for survival. It is made for us to sell ourselves and our authenticity. It is made for us to deprive ourselves to get to a point where we are praised. I understand that there a many beautiful people living in the world, I've met some, but it feels like there will just always be a flood of sadness every time we are confronted with the world. I'm afraid that being a functioning, loving being will just cause me to experience a lot of dissonance between myself and what the world is like.

I think that the world is made for people like my father and my stepmother. And there was a point in time where I could feel myself becoming like them, and I couldn't. Even though I did not even know what was happening. I did not even realize the change that was happening to me. All I knew that was that if I kept going, I would be changed permanently. And so I took a step back. And it is a line that I will not be able to cross again, because I am now aware of what the line is. This all adds on top of this sense of doom that I will not be able to exist in the world, it feels like the doom is not just internal because I feel like I am unable to change, but also because the world is the way that it is. So no matter what I might do, I don't think there is a place in this world for me. Then again, maybe I have not experienced enough years on this world (I am young, did I say that already) to know what is all out there. Then again, I don't think I will get to a point where I am strong enough to experience more of the world, because I am not strong enough to exist in the world, I feel I am getting weaker, disappearing, dying. And then again, I have lived, and my experience in the world is very valid and real, real enough for me to know what I am talking about. I trust myself enough to know that I am not deceived by my own perception.

So I am considering to die. This thought has been crossing my mind for a few years now, but it’s always been a fearful thought, because I felt cornered, because I had nowhere to go.

This time it is different. I can feel completely okay with dying, because in some way it feels like my destiny. I know there could be a way for me to exist and live, but I cannot get there.

Yesterday I completely let go of my need to escape, because I was forced into my reality, something that I would have never done myself. I was forced by my stepmother forcing her reality over me completely, trying to take the last part of me, and something came over me. It was instinctive. It was her desperate grab for control over me, so she could maintain control over her own reality. And so I yelled. I yelled at my stepmother that I am terrified of her, repeatedly. And in doing that, all of the bridges built on the illusion of trust between us were burned. I felt like it was the end. Turns out that It wasn’t exactly the end, but it kind of was. I emptied my heart out to her, and she erased me. She took control over the conversation, and forced her reality on to me, or tried to at least. She forced her reality on to the life/ situation/ world that her, my father and me are living in. I held on to my reality, but just for myself. I can only let it exist in my own head, so I myself can only exist in my own head. Because she will take control. Her word is what counts, and what I think, and feel, it doesn't matter. No matter how good I can argue my point, or express how I feel. She wins. But she will never get the last part of me. I will not redeem her from her own self hatred. What I learned and realized from this situation is that this is what happens whenever I try to exist. It is like I was born without free will. Or more precisely, It was slowly taken from me. My reality was taken from me. And now that I have my reality back, I see that I can die with it, or lose it. I feel like it comes down to this choice. Because of how I was raised, and because of the way majority of people are. I do not want to betray myself again (and I am getting teary while writing this). No matter how much I wish to not betray myself, to hold on to my own reality, it doesn’t really matter. Other people will try to take it from me. This is what I was raised to know, even though I wish to believe otherwise. It is how I was gardened. And no matter how much I try to believe that there are realities out there where there is love, because there are. It is not my reality. I was gardened to let go of my own reality. To live in others people's garden. Where they can be the gardener and they will decide how I will be shaped and shifted, gardened and cut, wether I will be placed in a spot where the sun shines in the morning, or in a corner behind another big tree, or fountain, or whatever casts a shadow. And whether the gardener wants their plant to look nice and grow freely, or stunt growth and take cuttings.

I can accept the reality of my dying because I believe I was accidentally raised to suffer. I was raised to suffer out of unawareness. I do not have control over who I am, no matter how much I try.

Because there are people like my mother and my stepmother.

Because the world wants people, and myself (of course, I am people), to be like my mother and my stepmother.

So I don't think I can live without suffering. I feel pretty helpless and quite hopeless. I am at a crossroads and I really am desperate.

What a relief to type this out.

<p>My father is being controlled, but he doesn&#39;t know it, and he will not ever come to a point where he can see it. I have tried many times to talk to him, to hope that he will become aware of his patterns, but I&#39;m met with defensiveness, and twisting around, blaming even. And I forgive him for it. I am not angry with him. I am just trying to seek a solution but it all feels very out of reach. My father cannot teach me how to love and trust because he does not know what it is either. He is a man on autopilot, a gardener gardening some plants but he has no idea why he is a gardener, how gardening even works, or that a plant needs water. He provides, yes. He is a friendly man, yes. He is objectively charming, yes. He wears expensive clothes and has a mega shoe collection, yes. He gives me gifts that make my life easier for which I am very thankful, yes. But is there emotional depth? no. Is there anything that means anything in what he says to me? no. Is there just a large pool of empty nothingness behind this facade of succes? yes. He mirrors me in conversations we have. He seeks for my approval. And it erases me (again, I can barely grasp the fact that I still exist after being erased so much). It minimizes me to nothing, because he sees the bare minimum of who I am. He is not interested in who I am or getting to know me, or teaching me anything about the world or how to exist. He just needs to keep his head above water. He needs my stepmother to see that he is putting in effort so that he can get her approval. When I am myself in the conversations that we have -because he convinces himself we have these conversations to get to know each other and talk through what happened in the past- to a point where he cannot feel approved, he switches in his personality. He feels threatened and intimidated. And what I say to him feels like an attack, regardless of the way in which I tell him. And when I see his face it is like I almost cannot recognize him. It is scary, kind of like that <a href=""https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-the-uncanny-valley-4846247"">uncanny valley</a> effect. A thought comes up that I try to push and shove away. &#39;He is not human&#39;. But then I think. maybe he is just too human. Or he is just a human way too adapted to the world. Because the world has asked him to do this. The world forced him to be this way. He let go of his own free will.</p>

<p>I cannot ask my father and stepmother to change. All I can do is ask to them to accept me like a human being, along with my sadness and at this point in my life not very objectively successfully existing. But asking that, is asking them to change. Because they are unable to accept me and my existence being the people that they are. They need me to change before they accept me (mainly my stepmom, my father doesn&#39;t really care what I do, to him I actually don&#39;t really exist, because he doesn&#39;t know me, and is unable to get to know me because he is only keeping his head above water, it&#39;s his way of existing. it&#39;s almost like he doesn&#39;t have any emotions, which he does have of course, but he doesn&#39;t know what any of it means and he just suppresses and suppresses and he will never stop doing that. I think the only emotions he really feels are threat, and safety, and I, am a threat. (to his reality, what he believes about himself, because I disagree (I&#39;m not forcing my reality upon him thought, but me just living in another reality in his reality is enough to feel threatened) ) and even then I don&#39;t think I can exist, because it is not about me changing for the better or being objectively successful (even though she probably tells herself this), it is about her having control over her own reality, in which I&#39;m existing, because it is how life played out. It is an outcome of decisions her and my father made, in which I am a passive object. And I feel stuck. And then again, I feel the need to escape. Both escape the situation, life, but more than that myself. I am trying to escape my stepmother, my father, their reality, myself as the person they are forcing me to be. (I feel so much like a stereotype I start to feel ashamed even though I know I am not this person and it is the circumstances that are forcing me to be this way.)</p>

<p>I try to escape to a place where my I can exist in my own reality and it is pretty much nowhere to be found.</p>

<p>Because I cannot exist where I am right now, or grow where I am right now to a point where I am strong enough as a person, I feel stuck. I cannot exist in the world as the person that I am, because eventually my body will give up, my brain and body don&#39;t work together at all in that sense, and so I feel stuck.</p>

<p>My critical analytical thinking big brain skills have lead me to three possibilities.</p>

<ol>
<li>Exist in the world as is: Does not work, I will feel unhappy and I will want to escape. And eventually I will collapse because I get burned out. I will also not build any true friendships or relationships because I&#39;ll be inauthentic.</li>
<li>Change to exist in the world: I don&#39;t know how. I need someone to teach me how to change. I cannot ask my father, stepmother or mother. I&#39;ve had a bunch of therapists but the problem is that I get medicalized, or what I feel is medicalized, and needs to be fixed. A therapist cannot teach me what I need to learn. It is something that I needed to learn when I was a child, and this was unsuccessful. I also feel that now that I&#39;ve reached this point where I am no longer escaping, therapy for some reason no longer works. It&#39;s almost like therapy is there to help you to stop escaping yourself, see who you are, see your patterns, by working on it. And now that I know the full extent of my patters and that I can see who I am, it&#39;s like my therapist is just mirroring my self-reflectiveness. Because I&#39;m self aware enough (I hope haha). I show my self reflectiveness and it is reflected back on to me. And I don&#39;t an awful lot from that, nor progress in who I am and want to be. I&#39;ve also tried EMDR, to deal with some trauma&#39;s that my mother instilled in me, which helped, but it&#39;s not enough for me to change. It&#39;s not that I have been damaged. It is that I was deprived of something. I don&#39;t think therapy can heal that. I need a person to teach me. But it is impossible for me to ask that of someone. Also because no matter how much I want to, I feel like I can&#39;t get to a point where I let others help me.</li>
<li>Be forever alone: I will not be happy. Because some day sooner or later I will lose all my value in society, I will be old and unattractive, and alone, without money most likely because I would live an alone life, and it will no longer be a choice. Part of the peace that comes with choosing to be alone is the lie I tell myself that I could still have a life with other people. It is what happens now as well whenever I am alone. Peace comes over me, but part of that peace stems from imagining scenario&#39;s of the amazing live I could live, that I struggle so hard to make real.</li>
</ol>

<p>Some part of my struggle is also existential (yeah). Even if I were to fix myself and be able to exist in the world. This world is not made for living. It is made for survival. It is made for us to sell ourselves and our authenticity. It is made for us to deprive ourselves to get to a point where we are praised. I understand that there a many beautiful people living in the world, I&#39;ve met some, but it feels like there will just always be a flood of sadness every time we are confronted with the world. I&#39;m afraid that being a functioning, loving being will just cause me to experience a lot of dissonance between myself and what the world is like.</p>

<p>I think that the world is made for people like my father and my stepmother. And there was a point in time where I could feel myself becoming like them, and I couldn&#39;t. Even though I did not even know what was happening. I did not even realize the change that was happening to me. All I knew that was that if I kept going, I would be changed permanently. And so I took a step back. And it is a line that I will not be able to cross again, because I am now aware of what the line is. This all adds on top of this sense of doom that I will not be able to exist in the world, it feels like the doom is not just internal because I feel like I am unable to change, but also because the world is the way that it is. So no matter what I might do, I don&#39;t think there is a place in this world for me. Then again, maybe I have not experienced enough years on this world (I am young, did I say that already) to know what is all out there. Then again, I don&#39;t think I will get to a point where I am strong enough to experience more of the world, because I am not strong enough to exist in the world, I feel I am getting weaker, disappearing, dying. And then again, I have lived, and my experience in the world is very valid and real, real enough for me to know what I am talking about. I trust myself enough to know that I am not deceived by my own perception.</p>

<p>So I am considering to die. This thought has been crossing my mind for a few years now, but it’s always been a fearful thought, because I felt cornered, because I had nowhere to go.</p>

<p>This time it is different. I can feel completely okay with dying, because in some way it feels like my destiny. I know there could be a way for me to exist and live, but I cannot get there.</p>

<p>Yesterday I completely let go of my need to escape, because I was forced into my reality, something that I would have never done myself. I was forced by my stepmother forcing her reality over me completely, trying to take the last part of me, and something came over me. It was instinctive. It was her desperate grab for control over me, so she could maintain control over her own reality. And so I yelled. I yelled at my stepmother that I am terrified of her, repeatedly. And in doing that, all of the bridges built on the illusion of trust between us were burned. I felt like it was the end. Turns out that It wasn’t exactly the end, but it kind of was. I emptied my heart out to her, and she erased me. She took control over the conversation, and forced her reality on to me, or tried to at least. She forced her reality on to the life/ situation/ world that her, my father and me are living in. I held on to my reality, but just for myself. I can only let it exist in my own head, so I myself can only exist in my own head. Because she will take control. Her word is what counts, and what I think, and feel, it doesn&#39;t matter. No matter how good I can argue my point, or express how I feel. She wins. But she will never get the last part of me. I will not redeem her from her own self hatred. What I learned and realized from this situation is that this is what happens whenever I try to exist. It is like I was born without free will. Or more precisely, It was slowly taken from me. My reality was taken from me. And now that I have my reality back, I see that I can die with it, or lose it. I feel like it comes down to this choice. Because of how I was raised, and because of the way majority of people are. I do not want to betray myself again (and I am getting teary while writing this). No matter how much I wish to not betray myself, to hold on to my own reality, it doesn’t really matter. Other people will try to take it from me. This is what I was raised to know, even though I wish to believe otherwise. It is how I was gardened. And no matter how much I try to believe that there are realities out there where there is love, because there are. It is not my reality. I was gardened to let go of my own reality. To live in others people&#39;s garden. Where they can be the gardener and they will decide how I will be shaped and shifted, gardened and cut, wether I will be placed in a spot where the sun shines in the morning, or in a corner behind another big tree, or fountain, or whatever casts a shadow. And whether the gardener wants their plant to look nice and grow freely, or stunt growth and take cuttings.</p>

<p>I can accept the reality of my dying because I believe I was accidentally raised to suffer. I was raised to suffer out of unawareness. I do not have control over who I am, no matter how much I try.</p>

<p>Because there are people like my mother and my stepmother.</p>

<p>Because the world wants people, and myself (of course, I am people), to be like my mother and my stepmother.</p>

<p>So I don&#39;t think I can live without suffering. I feel pretty helpless and quite hopeless. I am at a crossroads and I really am desperate.</p>

<p>What a relief to type this out.</p>

2048.0,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x00000184EBEFAFD0>,,SuicideWatch,"I was the smart kid, the one everyone loved, the teacher's pet, never got a bad grade, always on top of homework. Everyone was proud of me. Even I was proud of myself and then it all came tumbling down.

Now my head is completely blank unless I force thoughts into it, the cogs won't turn unless I'm either immediately reacting to something or forcing myself to make up words but this is far from some meditation because I'm still anxious and stressed. I have lost all motivation to even live and no desire to get it back, I don't feel any emotions and I'm slowly becoming insensitive and non-empathetic to the people I know and used to love. 

My memory almost is as bad as a goldfish. I haven't got any significant memories and even when I try to memorize something it just fades away in some days, it's not memory loss, they're not gone they're more of...locked away along with my emotions. And with all this I'm just left a husk of what once was treasured by everyone, now I'm just a disappointment, the problem child, the quite kid that hates people, the example you tell your kids to not follow, I've heard all of these phrases and more used refering to me by my family.

I've lost all emotional connections except for with my best friend and my little brother, everyone else is just another person, even my parents. I obviously want to have a bond with them but I can't and I'm slowly losing the two that I have left.

I haven't done anything all day yet I'm too exausted to  do anything. Too anxious to start something new and too tired to finish things I started a while ago. I'm just stuck in the middle of so many things at once but I'm not overwhelmed, I'm not whelmed at all (if that's even a word). I have no fear of failing in life even though I know I'm going to, I've got no regret of failing so far, haven't got any desire to do anything about it and no motivation to change my ways and yet I don't want to be the failure that I've already become. I can barely get off my bed sometimes. 

My body is full of voids that only go away if I hurt the spot they're at by for example punching myself. I'm sort of split in two parts, one is just laying down doing nothing while the other screams at it to either start working asap or stab myself, jump of the roof, break my own neck, bash my head untill I pass out etc. When one part is suffering the other makes me smile and laugh but not in a good way, so sometimes (this is a little rare) I end up being in pain or just suffering from something while giggling like a goblin to probably try and hide the pain, I'm not too sure why it happens either.

Every other day I wake up to my mother complaining about how much of a disappointment I am, that it'd probably would've been better if someone else was born instead of me, I'm just a huge burden and it's all true. To be honest, I'm not much happier with myself than she is.

To kill myself is no longer a personal urge for me, my lack of emotions got rid of that urge a while ago. It's now a moral obligation. To get rid of myself so that the ones closest to me are free to live their own lives, to save parents tonnes of money rather than using it up for my college and to save them the pain I'm going cause if I keep being alive.

I don't really deserve to be alive either. I'm just full of faults with no single good quality to make up for it, I don't even look good.

I can't really tell this to anyone because then I feel like I'm seeking for attention or being whiny, that I should just suck it up because everyone has problems and I should just learn to live with it, even as I'm writting this I feel the same.

Yet I'm here and alive but that's only because I could never actually get the courage to kill myself, I've tried countless times but I'd chicken away at the very last moment. It's pathetic, it's embarrassing. I'm just disappointed in myself. 

My life isn't difficult, so many people would give everything they have to be here instead of me, I'm just an ungrateful selfish brat that shouldn't even be alive. I'm just not good enough.

I can't seek professional help either because

1. I'm a minor and asking my parents is the last thing I'd do

Everyone was proud of me. Even I was proud of myself and then it all came tumbling down.</p>

<p>Now my head is completely blank unless I force thoughts into it, the cogs won&#39;t turn unless I&#39;m either immediately reacting to something or forcing myself to make up words but this is far from some meditation because I&#39;m still anxious and stressed. I have lost all motivation to even live and no desire to get it back, I don&#39;t feel any emotions and I&#39;m slowly becoming insensitive and non-empathetic to the people I know and used to love. </p>

<p>My memory almost is as bad as a goldfish. I haven&#39;t got any significant memories and even when I try to memorize something it just fades away in some days, it&#39;s not memory loss, they&#39;re not gone they&#39;re more of...locked away along with my emotions. And with all this I&#39;m just left a husk of what once was treasured by everyone, now I&#39;m just a disappointment, the problem child, the quite kid that hates people, the example you tell your kids to not follow, I&#39;ve heard all of these phrases and more used refering to me by my family.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve lost all emotional connections except for with my best friend and my little brother, everyone else is just another person, even my parents. I obviously want to have a bond with them but I can&#39;t and I&#39;m slowly losing the two that I have left.</p>

<p>I haven&#39;t done anything all day yet I&#39;m too exausted to  do anything. Too anxious to start something new and too tired to finish things I started a while ago. I&#39;m just stuck in the middle of so many things at once but I&#39;m not overwhelmed, I&#39;m not whelmed at all (if that&#39;s even a word). I have no fear of failing in life even though I know I&#39;m going to, I&#39;ve got no regret of failing so far, haven&#39;t got any desire to do anything about it and no motivation to change my ways and yet I don&#39;t want to be the failure that I&#39;ve already become. I can barely get off my bed sometimes. </p>

<p>My body is full of voids that only go away if I hurt the spot they&#39;re at by for example punching myself. I&#39;m sort of split in two parts, one is just laying down doing nothing while the other screams at it to either start working asap or stab myself, jump of the roof, break my own neck, bash my head untill I pass out etc. When one part is suffering the other makes me smile and laugh but not in a good way, so sometimes (this is a little rare) I end up being in pain or just suffering from something while giggling like a goblin to probably try and hide the pain, I&#39;m not too sure why it happens either.</p>

<p>Every other day I wake up to my mother complaining about how much of a disappointment I am, that it&#39;d probably would&#39;ve been better if someone else was born instead of me, I&#39;m just a huge burden and it&#39;s all true. To be honest, I&#39;m not much happier with myself than she is.</p>

<p>To kill myself is no longer a personal urge for me, my lack of emotions got rid of that urge a while ago. It&#39;s now a moral obligation. To get rid of myself so that the ones closest to me are free to live their own lives, to save parents tonnes of money rather than using it up for my college and to save them the pain I&#39;m going cause if I keep being alive.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t really deserve to be alive either. I&#39;m just full of faults with no single good quality to make up for it, I don&#39;t even look good.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t really tell this to anyone because then I feel like I&#39;m seeking for attention or being whiny, that I should just suck it up because everyone has problems and I should just learn to live with it, even as I&#39;m writting this I feel the same.</p>

<p>Yet I&#39;m here and alive but that&#39;s only because I could never actually get the courage to kill myself, I&#39;ve tried countless times but I&#39;d chicken away at the very last moment. It&#39;s pathetic, it&#39;s embarrassing. I&#39;m just disappointed in myself. </p>

<p>My life isn&#39;t difficult, so many people would give everything they have to be here instead of me, I&#39;m just an ungrateful selfish brat that shouldn&#39;t even be alive. I&#39;m just not good enough.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t seek professional help either because</p>

<p>It feels like I broke something in me the first time, my emotions just kind of shut down to an extent  It&#39;s like that first time put a bubble between me and the world, and I hate it. I guess whatever this bubble is does protect me from the objective horror of my attempts, but everything else feels off. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t feel real sometimes, like the world I&#39;m in isn&#39;t the one I almost left, fake almost. Even though I know it&#39;s not like that objectively</p>

I have no idea how unique or common my experience is.  I don't guess it matters.  I'm 45, married for 25 years, 5 kids.  My wife is a very devoted member of our church.  I pretend like I am, but I hate the church.  My kids are all struggling in various ways.  No special needs.  Just the effects of bad parenting, I guess.  But we haven't been bad parents.  We've tried, really hard, to help them.  I've gone to all of their activities.  We've never struggled with finances, or hunger, or stability, or anything like that.  We live in a nice home, in a nice community.  I work for myself, and make plenty of money.  Yet, my kids hate me, show no respect at all, are demanding.  We've spent $1,000s, maybe tens of thousands of dollars on parenting classes, counseling for them, counseling for us.  Every effort imaginable, but it's not likely to get any better with time.

She thinks I'm one person (a loving, loyal husband and father who works hard for his family, and believes in our church).  I have an online personae (anonymous) that is nothing like that person.

Somehow keeping those details straight among 10-15 people at a time.

I have never known who I am myself.  I am different depending on who I'm around, and what I think they expect of me.  I couldn't tell you what I like or dislike, unless I know the situation.

I am a sex addict, assuming there is such a thing.  Pornography, anonymous texting sites, dating sites, massage parlors, etc., are the only places and activities that numb me enough to get away from the constant feeling of self-hatred, anxiety over being discovered as a fraud, fear of what the future holds for me and my family, and all of that pain.  If my wife knew that I was involved in any way with any of those things, it would be catastrophic for her and our relationship, and yet I engage in those things daily, and have for decades, without her knowing.  The ability to compartmentalize is shocking.  

Although I have wished for death nearly my entire life, it has always felt like that wishing, in and of its self, is a form of numbing.  I've never really felt like I would follow through with doing anything.  Lately, however, it feels more like a viable thing. I have brought my gun to my office, and it's in the desk drawer.

but i went shopping with my mom the other day, to the dollar store down the street, and in the medicine aisle i saw an offbrand with the same potentially-fatal base drug in it. it has almost 10x the amount i took, so just one bottle of that could probably easily kill me, and now that i'm a legal adult, it'd be very easy to walk down there with some cash, buy a small variety of items, and hide the bottle from my family.

my only real regret in regards to my last attempt is that i didn't take enough. the temptation to purchase the bottle i saw is so, so strong. it's hard to try to act normal at school when every hour i'm without distraction is just spent sulking, planning, regretting, dreading, feeling nothing but lack of hope.

<p>one of the hardest parts of suicidal ideation and depression is the fight against yourself. i don&#39;t know how to explain to the people around me how much i dread asking for any kind of help, not because of stigma or shame, but because such a large part of me doesn&#39;t want it. it almost feels like a fucking addiction to misery. i went and asked my guidance office for resources today, to try and replace the therapist i recently dropped, and i wholeheartedly wanting nothing to do with being there, haha. </p>

<p>the small, rational part of me that accepts my need for help/improvement is so often drowned out by thoughts of suicide. it&#39;s odd having to steer such and unwilling vessel, a ship that&#39;s magnetized to the iceberg.</p>

<p>sorry if my thoughts are disjointed. they always are.</p>

My father passed away when I was 14 and my mom passed away when I was 19 in my arms. Both due to heart attack. They were not feeling sick at that time so it was sudden. My used to hit my mom and they were always fighting. My dad never talked to me properly so thought I'm doing something wrong and I used to study so hard to get good marks and he never really cared. My first relationship was really abusive and he used to hit me also he raped and tormented me for many years but it was difficult for me to get out of it idk why. When my mom got to know about the relationship she locked me up in the room took my cellphone and called me slut and every bad thing.
When I graduated school I got 87% because that was the very year my father died and I still was in shock but my mum cried and told me that she wasn't expecting such low results. I did every fucking thing to get their validation.
In fact all my life all I have done is trying to get their validation.
My elder sister stopped talking me when I was in school and she hates me since then. Idk what happened to her but she doesn't talk to me at all. I tried my best to get her validation but now I'm tired.
After high school I wanted to do computer engineering degree but my mom's brother told my mum that I should consider civil engineering and when I told my mum that I wanted to do computer engineering that person just told my mum to hit me and asked me to take civil engineering.
I did the diploma in civil engineering idk how that was hell my mother died in between the final exams and I graduated with 83% and all my relatives told me that those are shitty marks and I broke down.
I couldn't comlete my degree. I dropped out in the last year. I'm not doing anything since then.
I saw a stray kitten in those days and started feeding her because she was alone just like me and now we're best friends.
I wanted to bring her to my place but my sister didn't allow me and Im really tired to fight so just go and feed her everyday and try to spend at least half an hour with her. I get really anxious when I leave my house but I love her so I just do it everyday I don't want her to feel the way I feel about things but I'm reaching my limits I guess I'll find her a good home where she's safe and then I'll just kill myself.
It's really difficult for me to cook meals and take care of myself now I barely eat anything I just want all these things to end.
I'm so tired I cannot get up in the morning. 
I tried therapy and pills didn't work out for me.
Now I'm just addicted to sleeping pills because it's the only way to escape the reality.
Also I don't have have enough money to survive and enough energy to work so I need to do things quickly and kill myself.
I'm thinking about hanging myself but I want to do it right . I don't want to take any chances. So if you can just guide me through it, it will be really helpful.

2048.0,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x00000184EBEFAFD0>,,SuicideWatch,", i won't feel sadness. Neither would i regret it.

All this time, i have been helping depressive people, friends.
But not once, did someone try to help me.
Not once did they ask.

If i would be gone before tomorrow,
I know my time had come. 

I know the moments of sitting on my bed at 2 am, alone, crying silently in the dark, would be gone.
No more feelings of lonelyness or hopelessness. 
No more destroying myself physically to lower the mental pain.
No more almost breaking down in public.

My parents wouldn't be disappointed anymore.
I wouldn't be able to hurt friends.

All i've wanted, was to breath my last breath after seeing the sunset and looking at the sky.

But it seems even that is something impossible to do.

People say it's selfish to leave. But doesn't that make it selfish of them to long for people to stay too?

People say time heals. It doesn't. It covers until the scars show up again and they hurt more than they ever did.

I have so much to say, but no one is here to listen. No one cares; no one sees i don't want to be alive.

If tomorrow starts without me, i would look back at my life with a smile. It was better than i could ever wish for, but i guess it wasn't meant for me. 

If by tomorrow i would be away; it means i finally lost the fight against the monsters in my head.

What is wrong with me? I am always being a people pleaser and I try my best to not be awkward and try my best to not disagree with people because of my family and my fear of confrontation which I think came from my parents abuse. I legit asked my parents a question about college once and my mom threatened to slap the shit out of me. I treat everyone like I treat my parents, land mines, whereas if I don’t say the right thing or do the right thing they would explode. 

This goes onto friends. Most of the friends which I have usually I feel like treat me as though I am inferior. My first friend is just always being a show off and doesn’t like when I act silly and only actually talks to me when he needs shit mostly. 
My second friend is a strange fella, he only comes to me if he needs home work or help on a test, and the way he speaks is just strange. He legit had me on a face time call for almost an hour in order to get his missing assignments in, and guess what, I didn’t get any fucking compensation for it.

Whenever he is talking about what he believes in I just agree just because my fear of confrontation because I feel like I am surrounded by people like my parents. 
My third friend he is a little strange, he only comes to me for help aswell and never talks to me in the halls, and by never, I mean ever. Well that goes for actually my second friend as my third friend. They seem to never acknowledge my existence outside of when getting help from me. 
Also may I add I probably shouldn’t even call them friends but just people I know only because I go to school with them.

I have a fourth friend who never talks to me in a positive way Like he talks to others, like he is always being negative to me I feel, yet he talks to others nicely about sports and stuff and I think that’s because he doesn’t respect me as much as them but I might just be oversensitive ig. Something that stems from my mom.

I also really wish I was somebody who I wasn’t, and I am about to start trying to change my personality and who I am from a quiet introvert to a sporty extrovert. I don’t like myslef at all, Infact I despise myself.

To give a bit of background on myself, I'm a former Marine who just transitioned from the Marine Corps. I grew up in a very violent community with little opportunity, in a house with a mentally-disabled brother.

So let's start the show.

Younger Years (0-12)

Growing up, I never really had much confidence. All the attention always went to my brother due to his autism. I was often jealous and harbored resentment towards my parents. In my first year of elementary school (I was 5), I was diagnosed with ADHD and I routinely suffered from tremendous migraines and headaches from a lack of appetite and there would be days where I didn't eat. Kicking and screaming for the next five years, I endured that Adderall hell. Once my Mom talked sense into my Dad, they took me off the medication. My performance at school started to suffer and my parents would always compare my efforts against other students, and whether I did well it wasn't good enough because some other kid did better, and if I did poorly, then why did some other kid do better than me. I developed low self-esteem and thoughts of inadequacy early on in my life. To make matter worse, that same year I left all of my friends and ended up moving into a predominantly white neighborhood where my family was often targeted by the community, cops, and I by the kids in the neighborhood. I often cried in my room and isolated myself. It was also around that time my cousin introduced me to gaming and showed me people who were getting paid to do it. In an effort to become a pro gamer, I isolated even more, rarely going outside, and if I did it was to play basketball or attend basketball practices for the rec junior team I was on. I was vehemently bullied by the kids in my new community. Whether I was at school, basketball practice, or shooting some hoops at home, I was targeted. Cops would tear down my basketball court while I was at school or kids from school would chase me with belts trying to ""whip the black off of me"" and sometimes would take my money or make fun of me in front of my crushes or threaten physical violence. I always felt alone, at home I felt alone, at school I felt alone, and eventually, I developed an inability to trust anyone, including my parents.

High School (12-17)

I carried this mindset into high school, where I faced less opposition, but still the same issues. I was often referred to as repulsive and was propped up as a joke, thus I began to see myself as repulsive. I was extremely attractive but never believed that because I was always told I was not. In school, I always felt like I never fit in even though I performed exceptionally at sports. On the homefront, my parents tried to quarterback and dictate my life for me, but at that time I still wanted to become a pro gamer so I was still throwing all my eggs into that basket. Up until 18, my parents tried to control my future by sending me to 3-month music camps (I was essentially a jazz prodigy), playing with travel junior orchestras, but the problem was I HATED it, and every time I made mention of this, it was shrugged off. I eventually stopped telling people my problems because who the fuck would listen anyway? All anyone is going to say is, ""try harder"", or ""you should appreciate what you have...blah blah blah"". In the 11th grade, our star baseball player committed suicide and I remember thinking, man that guy is lucky, I wish I was strong enough to go through with it, but I'm just a pussy. I remember hating myself, hating who I was, just thinking I was this huge failure. I trie to befriend people, I even got lucky and ended up dating a super popular girl. She ended up dumping me and having sex with this guy while we were on a class trip to Washington D.C. I remember not even being angry, but thinking, ""Why would it have been different, who wants a guy like me? My parents can't even be bothered to look in my direction, and they're my caretakers."" With that thought, I rabbit-holed deeper. I put a mask on at this point in an attempt to cover up my shortcomings in preparation for college.

College (17-21)

In college, I tried to redefine myself, but I learned very quickly that many people saw through my genjutsu (illusion) to see me for who I really was. I was back to square one. I filled my head with such negative talk calling myself things like ""A stupid loser who can't get anything right"". Even my attempts to make it pro were falling short, the one goal I sacrificed so much for. I fell into an incredibly deep depression eating maybe 3-4 times out of the week. My RAs would find me in bed and berate me for my messy room, at this point I was sure that I was just a dumbass motherfucker who just sucked and life and it was my destiny to have a shitty life for someone who is much better than me to live the life they deserve. I made terrible friends who were awful influences on me. I would skip class to smoke weed or miss homework assignments to finally hang out with ""friends who liked me for me"". I found myself on academic probation very quickly shortly after, and my ""friends"" often used my guilt against me to make me do things I wasn't comfortable doing. It was at this moment (he fucked up, jk lmao), my willpower depleted I dropped out of college with my head held low.

Military (21-29)

I found quick success in the Marines, my ability to absorb abuse and continue pushing forward allowed me to shine over my peers and gave me a sheen of resiliency. For the first time in my life, I'm feeling I'm hitting my stride, but remember...my life fucking sucks so something bad has to happen. Once I reached 22, I started having lower back and knee problems and I was diagnosed with scoliosis and patella tendonitis. I wasn't too concerned about the latter, but like I said my life fucking sucks so for the next 8 years back and knee pains plagued me sinking me deeper into depression. The girl I dated while I was in the military ended up getting pregnant by another guy while I was on a MEU. The next girl I dated ended up leaving me the minute I went to the field. I spent 23-26 by myself until I dated another girl, and because I felt I didn't deserve anything good I ended up cheating on her, and to this day I kick myself in the head because she was the only one who truly understood me and never made fun of what I went through and accepted every weird quirk about me. I ended updating this one girl, and boy was this the worst relationship decision I ever made. Since dating her, I've had to deal with her pesky ex numerous times and that took a toll on my mental personally. She's done nothing but manipulate and gaslight me. I've tried leaving her and she had a warrant out for my arrest after claiming I sexually assaulted her. She shortly thereafter rescinded her statement, but this didn't go without my command hearing about this and getting up my ass about it for 2 years. I would say this completely broke and shattered me, and of course, I was penniless during this time and I still chose to get out of the Marines.

Transition (29-30)

I'm still transitioning out of the Marine Corps, and after 8 years of service, I thoroughly underestimated this process. I felt alone as a kid, now I'm in a state I don't know, working a job I hate in a position where no one can even begin to understand what I'm going through. The doctor I went to through the VA basically diagnosed me with severe carpal tunnel and I can't play games like I used to and that was the only thing that brought me joy. I feel so fucking alone man, I don't know what to do anymore. I look back on my life and see nothing but failure. I look at what other people do and wonder why can't I be that. No one really helps and I just feel like curling into a ball and disappearing into nothing. I just want it to stop. I just want to matter to someone, I don't know what I did to deserve this. I'm 30 years old with crippling debt, living on pb&j, and turkey sandwiches. I keep telling myself that I'll make it, but I don't even believe that bullshit. Every time I do a pro/con list, death is the better choice. I know it's an permanent solution to a temporary problem, but this has been my life and I feel like I'm the temporary problem at this point and no amount of troubleshooting will fix this.

I can't even say I'm a shell of who I used to be, because that would imply I had worth. I'm nothing, will be nothing. I can't remember when I felt emotional about something. I would go get help, but I'm afraid this will be another instance where someone uses what I tell them against me, and right now I can't. I just feel like a dead soul in a shell just slumping from place to place.

I'm the fucking worst.

But Its so hard to keep going everyday. How do you keeping going? and dont say love because i&#39;ve found it to be empty of yourself if you are just full of someone else. What makes you happy on earth? Why did you stay? Everyone always says they stayed because they didnt want to hurt their family or friends but I truly dont think I would be missed by anyone. Im not a good or kind person and I make the people around me sad by being around them. I rely on them too much. Im a bad friend and I dont deserve the ones I have. I cant keep living in a world like this. I want to feel at peace. And now im sat here probably going to ruin someone elses good day by being depressing on the internet. Im sorry</p>

I'm not sure what kind. From what was told to me B feels like she just doesn't want to live anymore. Thoughts of suicide cross her mind when she's not distracted on her phone or some other media.

The morning after the attempt B confessed to their parents what they did. Of course, A and the rest of her family were distraught. They're not too sure what to do. They want to try counseling, but B has stated that they won't talk to the counselor. I of course want to find a way to help their family. However, I'm not too informed on these topics so I wasn't too sure what to say, but I want to find a way to help B. I wouldn't want to see B take her own life.

Since I was little I always had a weird relationship w/ death. 

At 2 I fell in our pond while my mom (8months pregnant at that time) was gardening next to me. She didn't hear me right away as she thought I was just throwing rock into the pond. When she saw she pulled me by the shirt. 
At 7, I found my father in the naked and asleep in the tub in the morning after a suicide attempt, I don't remember much of it except going to see him in the Parc of the psych ward. 

At 9, one of my younger brother (let say #2 as I have 2 little brother and a big one) fell in an iced lake, I jump into the water to save him, I got him to the embankment but it was slippery, so he push on my shoulders, and I slipped under the ice. The last thing I remember is being extremely calm when I realise it was over. I somehow got near the embankment and I don't know how I got out. I took my brother inside the house, took of his clothes. My dad saw us and helped my brother and made him a warm bath. Me on the other end managed myself. 

From 9 to 19 The same brother (#2) would break doors and other things to beat me. 

At 15 I left abroad in an adopted family, there my boyfriend at the time, had a cardiac arrest during practice, I was supposed to meet him there and found him alone. I started CPR. Scream all I could possibly get out of chest for someone to call an ambulance. I didn't see anyone for a few minutes and a teacher came out. He past away before the ambulance got there. 

At age 18. We were on vacation with my dad and little brother (#2), we took a boat to move away from the coast and get to a inflatable playground. Many people were with us. At one point a little boy (11/12) fell from the structure is dad was dealing with a cramp a little further. I saw him and swam to rescue him. He panicked and kept pushing underwater to keep his head outside. I became really tired and started drowning which actually got me free from him. I got back out, two rescuers came with a jet ski took the little boy and ask if I was OK. I said yes and swam back to the boat. At that moment they had to held me to get on it. I layed down on the stern and felt my entire body hurt as he'll. My dad and brother just watched and waited until I got back up.

At 19. I got raped by a boyfriend, I told the police who said they said that it will be dismissal. I told my older brother. He told my entire family. My mom came to me, asked me to tell her what happened, hugged me and left my room. She sent me to the psych ward and we never talked about it ever.

At 26. My little brother [#1], was assassinated for being gay and doing drag. 

At 27. My mom died ( I stopped talking to her at 24) 

Now 28. Because of some medication I'm taking (I developed certain  disorders) my doc explained to me that by 50 it would be a good idea to make sure I knew what I wanted to for my will, and maybe pay for my funeral to protect my family.

What feels worse is that the job I left did not prepare me at all for moving onto my next job.

I really want to kill myself. Nothing in my life ever works. Ever since I was young everything is always so horrible. I'm always the odd one out, the outcast, and everyone made sure to let me know.

My mother never bothered to ask what would make me happy she only decides on her own and thinks I would be happy with her decision for me.

My brother never failed to remind me that he doesn't want me around. We never talked, there's nothing to talk about. My father is indifferent and uncaring, he's also horribly judgmental.

The place I lived in for 18 years is a squalid hamster box. A very small up-and-down house built from very low-cost materials. The water supply is scarce on on most days, it is especially bad during mornings because 99% of the neighborhood are showering at almost the same time on mornings. The water supply is also not that clean, it's laden with rust and weird residue, it's utterly disgusting.

The whole neighborhood is also infested with pests; cockroaches, rats, and everything else. You might think our family is dirt poor, but we're technically not, my mother is a government auditor and my father is a the chief engineer of a cargo ship, so there's really no excuse for how our lifestyle turned out.

My family moved to a new neighborhood two years ago. It's more spacious and cleaner but out problem here now are insufferable neighbors: kids shouting/disrespecting us, guy's who'd rev their motorcycles while passing by alley beside my bedroom at ungodly hours, and dogs that would bark nonstop. I feel like no matter where we go we always attract bad luck.

My parents are financially illiterate and decision-making is rocket science for them. My father wastes his money on his relatives and other people whom he barely knows. He also squanders his money on useless things that make him broke; like airsoft guns and motorbikes (which he doesn't even use because he's not home 99% of the time because of his work). I've never gotten a gift from him in my entire life, so I don't ask him for anything at all. He's also never supported me financially, I can't really ask him for money because he makes it apparent that he's averse to giving me monetary help.

My mother is a fussy person who cares more about trivial things that shouldn't matter over things that should be taken seriously. she's allergic to taking risks that's why she settles for subpar things in life; our tiny house in a dingy neighborhood, for example. She's also a control-freak who thinks all her decisions are right. She forces me to greet my brother on his birthday because he's ""my older brother"" but she doesn't bat an eyelid if my brother doesn't greet me. He's never wished me a happy birthday my entire life, it makes sense because he hates me. In short, everyone in my family is just downright selfish.

Mom always made sure to remind me of how ugly I am ever since I was young. She'd also berate me and embarrass me in public. It's one of the reasons why I'm so silent, I don't want to embarrass myself in public over and over again.

I told her when I was in my second year that I wanted to shift majors but she did not allow me. I remember when I passed the boards, lol, they were so nervous because they expected me not to pass the boards. They set really low expectations for me, I suppose it's valid, because I'm totally worthless. They also didn't even congratulate me much or even buy me a gift, most people I knew got gifts from their parents when they passed the boards, I don't want expensive shit, just the thought of it already makes it special. But I'm just not special for them, truthfully, I'm not special to anyone but I'm used to it by now.

Instead of patting my back for surpassing an endeavor I did not ask for, they only pressured me about finding work. I have repeated over and over again to my mom how much I don't want to be a physical therapist but as usual, I'm a ghost when it comes to my family, my opinions weigh as much as air. Don't get me started about peers. I did not fit in with anyone in school ever since I could remember and I'm always the subject of ridicule no matter how hard I try to appear small and invisible.

I guess there's just something about me that make others bully me so easily. It was already bad in the first school I attended but then my mother forced me to transfer to an all-girls school for high school and things just went even more downhill from there.

My confidence in myself waned even more because my new classmates were always so upfront about how much of a loser I am. Even in college, I'm still the person everyone loves to make fun of.

I made a few friends but none of those friendships lasted long. On the topic of friends, I never had anyone whom I could truly call my friend.

Most of the friendships I've had never lasted more than five years. Everyone easily grows tired of me and I can't blame them, I'm truly an unremarkable and terribly dull person. Now, I'm 23 years old and still jobless. Every job interview I've had is just...I can't even find the right words to describe it.

I started a food business from home last year but it never really took off, so now I'm back to job hunting but I've already lost all my confidence to go on. I have a boyfriend but I feel like he's growing tired of me and my problems, too. I also still live in my parents' house. I feel like my life can't get any worse.

Should I just kill myself so that the world will have more space for someone more useful?

Nothing in my life ever works. Ever since I was young everything is always so horrible. I&#39;m always the odd one out, the outcast, and everyone made sure to let me know.</p>

<p>My mother never bothered to ask what would make me happy she only decides on her own and thinks I would be happy with her decision for me.</p>

<p>My brother never failed to remind me that he doesn&#39;t want me around. We never talked, there&#39;s nothing to talk about. My father is indifferent and uncaring, he&#39;s also horribly judgmental.</p>

<p>The place I lived in for 18 years is a squalid hamster box. A very small up-and-down house built from very low-cost materials. The water supply is scarce on on most days, it is especially bad during mornings because 99% of the neighborhood are showering at almost the same time on mornings. The water supply is also not that clean, it&#39;s laden with rust and weird residue, it&#39;s utterly disgusting.</p>

<p>The whole neighborhood is also infested with pests; cockroaches, rats, and everything else. You might think our family is dirt poor, but we&#39;re technically not, my mother is a government auditor and my father is a the chief engineer of a cargo ship, so there&#39;s really no excuse for how our lifestyle turned out.</p>

<p>My family moved to a new neighborhood two years ago. It&#39;s more spacious and cleaner but out problem here now are insufferable neighbors: kids shouting/disrespecting us, guy&#39;s who&#39;d rev their motorcycles while passing by alley beside my bedroom at ungodly hours, and dogs that would bark nonstop. I feel like no matter where we go we always attract bad luck.</p>

<p>My parents are financially illiterate and decision-making is rocket science for them. My father wastes his money on his relatives and other people whom he barely knows. He also squanders his money on useless things that make him broke; like airsoft guns and motorbikes (which he doesn&#39;t even use because he&#39;s not home 99% of the time because of his work). I&#39;ve never gotten a gift from him in my entire life, so I don&#39;t ask him for anything at all. He&#39;s also never supported me financially, I can&#39;t really ask him for money because he makes it apparent that he&#39;s averse to giving me monetary help.</p>

<p>My mother is a fussy person who cares more about trivial things that shouldn&#39;t matter over things that should be taken seriously. she&#39;s allergic to taking risks that&#39;s why she settles for subpar things in life; our tiny house in a dingy neighborhood, for example. She&#39;s also a control-freak who thinks all her decisions are right. She forces me to greet my brother on his birthday because he&#39;s &quot;my older brother&quot; but she doesn&#39;t bat an eyelid if my brother doesn&#39;t greet me. He&#39;s never wished me a happy birthday my entire life, it makes sense because he hates me. In short, everyone in my family is just downright selfish.</p>

<p>Mom always made sure to remind me of how ugly I am ever since I was young. She&#39;d also berate me and embarrass me in public. It&#39;s one of the reasons why I&#39;m so silent, I don&#39;t want to embarrass myself in public over and over again.</p>

And that this or that would be too much of agony or not really rational. And just help to set up the thing. And you don&#39;t want to feel walking alone in this kinda thing. People are scared of doing sth on their own. And it makes sense . More heads have a bigger chance producing good ideas.
Or maybe it is just that i want to change my mind badly. And another factor in the equation as another person makes it more probable. Another words I like to question myself and my motivation. But I have constant thoughts about dying and an immense fear of doing it as well no matter how badly I want to be over with things
But I feel stronger about making it being sth like a double suicide when you help each other with care and as like-minded individuals bc nobody else would understand the shear dissatisfaction from life you feel every second and aimlessness. People can unite under common goals and there is sth beautiful about it even if it is really twisted in this example.And you want to share at least sth in your life with sb. At least these final last steps that are full of fear will be easier to make for both.</p>

I’ve done and dealt with horrible things and it’s hard to escape. Everyone says that suicide is not the answer and it doesn’t fix things. But in my case, it does.

All I wanted to be was a normal, Transgender kid with friends, social skills and not mental illness and be raised in a religon that’s hell. Mom, if you’re reading this, I don’t hate you anymore and none of this is your fault. All you wanted to do is just be a loving parent and raise me in the best spiritual way. I’m sorry for the way I’ve disrespected you. I’m sorry I was such a brat.I’m sorry I made your life hell and made your depression and stress go up, I’m sorry that I’m Trans and I’m sorry for the fact that you didn’t wanna raise a Trans kid who wasn’t a jw anymore.. But I loved you and always did even when I did the most messed up thing. I love you and my family. Give cotton and scrappy a good rub for me.

I really want to kill myself. Nothing in my life ever works. Ever since I was young everything is always so horrible. I'm always the odd one out, the outcast, and everyone made sure to let me know.

My mother never bothered to ask what would make me happy she only decides on her own and thinks I would be happy with her decision for me.

My brother never failed to remind me that he doesn't want me around. We never talked, there's nothing to talk about. My father is indifferent and uncaring, he's also horribly judgmental.

The place I lived in for 18 years is a squalid hamster box. A very small up-and-down house built from very low-cost materials. The water supply is scarce on on most days, it is especially bad during mornings because 99% of the neighborhood are showering at almost the same time on mornings. The water supply is also not that clean, it's laden with rust and weird residue, it's utterly disgusting.

The whole neighborhood is also infested with pests; cockroaches, rats, and everything else. You might think our family is dirt poor, but we're technically not, my mother is a government auditor and my father is a the chief engineer of a cargo ship, so there's really no excuse for how our lifestyle turned out.

My family moved to a new neighborhood two years ago. It's more spacious and cleaner but out problem here now are insufferable neighbors: kids shouting/disrespecting us, guy's who'd rev their motorcycles while passing by alley beside my bedroom at ungodly hours, and dogs that would bark nonstop. I feel like no matter where we go we always attract bad luck.

My parents are financially illiterate and decision-making is rocket science for them. My father wastes his money on his relatives and other people whom he barely knows. He also squanders his money on useless things that make him broke; like airsoft guns and motorbikes (which he doesn't even use because he's not home 99% of the time because of his work). I've never gotten a gift from him in my entire life, so I don't ask him for anything at all. He's also never supported me financially, I can't really ask him for money because he makes it apparent that he's averse to giving me monetary help.

My mother is a fussy person who cares more about trivial things that shouldn't matter over things that should be taken seriously. she's allergic to taking risks that's why she settles for subpar things in life; our tiny house in a dingy neighborhood, for example. She's also a control-freak who thinks all her decisions are right. She forces me to greet my brother on his birthday because he's ""my older brother"" but she doesn't bat an eyelid if my brother doesn't greet me. He's never wished me a happy birthday my entire life, it makes sense because he hates me. In short, everyone in my family is just downright selfish.

Mom always made sure to remind me of how ugly I am ever since I was young. She'd also berate me and embarrass me in public. It's one of the reasons why I'm so silent, I don't want to embarrass myself in public over and over again.

She also makes me feel so incompetent, my dad is the same. He also ridicules me every chance he could get. My mother forced me to take a major in Physical Therapy. I told her when I was in my second year that I wanted to shift majors but she did not allow me. I remember when I passed the boards, lol, they were so nervous because they expected me not to pass the boards. They set really low expectations for me, I suppose it's valid, because I'm totally worthless. They also didn't even congratulate me much or even buy me a gift, most people I knew got gifts from their parents when they passed the boards, I don't want expensive shit, just the thought of it already makes it special. But I'm just not special for them, truthfully, I'm not special to anyone but I'm used to it by now.

Instead of patting my back for surpassing an endeavor I did not ask for, they only pressured me about finding work. I have repeated over and over again to my mom how much I don't want to be a physical therapist but as usual, I'm a ghost when it comes to my family, my opinions weigh as much as air. Don't get me started about peers. I did not fit in with anyone in school ever since I could remember and I'm always the subject of ridicule no matter how hard I try to appear small and invisible.

I guess there's just something about me that make others bully me so easily. It was already bad in the first school I attended but then my mother forced me to transfer to an all-girls school for high school and things just went even more downhill from there.

My confidence in myself waned even more because my new classmates were always so upfront about how much of a loser I am. Even in college, I'm still the person everyone loves to make fun of.

I made a few friends but none of those friendships lasted long. On the topic of friends, I never had anyone whom I could truly call my friend.

Most of the friendships I've had never lasted more than five years. Everyone easily grows tired of me and I can't blame them, I'm truly an unremarkable and terribly dull person. Now, I'm 23 years old and still jobless. Every job interview I've had is just...I can't even find the right words to describe it.

I started a food business from home last year but it never really took off, so now I'm back to job hunting but I've already lost all my confidence to go on. I have a boyfriend but I feel like he's growing tired of me and my problems, too. I also still live in my parents' house. I feel like my life can't get any worse.

2048.0,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x00000184EBEFAFD0>,,SuicideWatch,"I’ll preface this by saying I used to be suicidal myself. I’m an addict in recovery who’s struggled with severe depression in the past, I’ve attempted suicide once with no lasting consequences. I’ve already lost one good friend to suicide, as well as an uncle and other friends to drug addiction, which I consider to be a similar condition in terms of the hopeless mindset. I still struggle with some things but I’m much more emotionally stable now, with a more realistic view on life (which I consider to be the main contributing factor to my healthier mindset).

My best friend (22F) is one of the best people I know, very compassionate and empathetic. In terms of mental illness, she’s been diagnosed with schizoaffective bipolar, dissociative identity, borderline personality, and ptsd from physical/sexual violations she’s experienced many times in her life. None of these necessarily describe exactly what she’s like, but they may give you an idea of how she thinks. She’s been suicidal to different degrees the whole time I’ve known her, frequently citing that me and her daughter (now 3 yo) are the only reasons she’s still alive. At least once a week, sometimes more, she experiences some sort of breakdown and mentions wanting to kill herself, sometimes it gets to the point where she’s in a blackout manic state wrapping a belt around her neck. She’s abused a lot of meth and hallucinogens in the past and she continues to do so, albeit to a lesser extent. She just recently started using meth again, maybe 3 times in the last month and just last night had a very strong psychedelic experience with other people she doesn’t know very well. Today she was talking about suicide again. To me, the pattern seems to be that some combination of stress with other emotions and delusional thinking leads her to the conclusion that it would be better if she died. She says that either she can’t go on struggling in this shitty world or that everyone else would be better off with her gone. She will say she wants accountability, but ignores me or pushes me away when I try to help.

Usually my method of trying to calm her down to to reassure and empathize - I know what you’re going through, you’re not alone, people love and care for you, I’m always here for you, etc. I’ve had to do this in different ways considering how often it seems to happen, I don’t like to be repetitive but I know she needs to be reminded of certain things when the delusions are dominant. Sometimes she hallucinates and when this happens it’s like a complete break from reality, not knowing what she’s experiencing in that moment makes it difficult for me to know what would help, if anything. I’ll usually try to offer some sort of advice after the intensity of her emotional state dies down, telling her simply my opinion on something or saying something like “this is what helped me” before briefly mentioning thought redirection, mindfulness, emotional regulation, or any other coping skill I’ve learned. I might suggest some journaling or something simple that can assist her with processing everything. Unfortunately, it seems like nothing she learns ever sticks. Either she doesn’t think of it, doesn’t believe or trust it, or just doesn’t put it into practice. She will often feel incapable of doing things that would probably help. It’s always a vicious cycle - she wants to feel better but the part of her housing that self-hatred holds her back from doing anything that might help for more than a day or two. It seems like she almost always tells me when she’s so “not okay” to the point of acting on suicidal impulses, which is a positive. I’m just afraid that one of these days I might not be able to help enough. I’ll always be there for her, so if I have to I’ll just continue doing what I can. I know ultimately the long-term change has to come from her, but I’d like to know if there’s anything more I can do. She also refuses to go inpatient again because her grandparents have custody of her daughter, and any indication that she’s “unfit” to be a parent will invoke them to withhold custody for even longer (one of the situations which contributes to her depression).",t2_71dgyq0y,False,,0.0,False,My best friend is chronically suicidal and I’ve done everything I can think of.

I still struggle with some things but I’m much more emotionally stable now, with a more realistic view on life (which I consider to be the main contributing factor to my healthier mindset).</p>

<p>My best friend (22F) is one of the best people I know, very compassionate and empathetic. In terms of mental illness, she’s been diagnosed with schizoaffective bipolar, dissociative identity, borderline personality, and ptsd from physical/sexual violations she’s experienced many times in her life. None of these necessarily describe exactly what she’s like, but they may give you an idea of how she thinks. She’s been suicidal to different degrees the whole time I’ve known her, frequently citing that me and her daughter (now 3 yo) are the only reasons she’s still alive. At least once a week, sometimes more, she experiences some sort of breakdown and mentions wanting to kill herself, sometimes it gets to the point where she’s in a blackout manic state wrapping a belt around her neck. She’s abused a lot of meth and hallucinogens in the past and she continues to do so, albeit to a lesser extent. She just recently started using meth again, maybe 3 times in the last month and just last night had a very strong psychedelic experience with other people she doesn’t know very well. Today she was talking about suicide again. To me, the pattern seems to be that some combination of stress with other emotions and delusional thinking leads her to the conclusion that it would be better if she died. She says that either she can’t go on struggling in this shitty world or that everyone else would be better off with her gone. She will say she wants accountability, but ignores me or pushes me away when I try to help.</p>

<p>Usually my method of trying to calm her down to to reassure and empathize - I know what you’re going through, you’re not alone, people love and care for you, I’m always here for you, etc. I’ve had to do this in different ways considering how often it seems to happen, I don’t like to be repetitive but I know she needs to be reminded of certain things when the delusions are dominant. Sometimes she hallucinates and when this happens it’s like a complete break from reality, not knowing what she’s experiencing in that moment makes it difficult for me to know what would help, if anything. I’ll usually try to offer some sort of advice after the intensity of her emotional state dies down, telling her simply my opinion on something or saying something like “this is what helped me” before briefly mentioning thought redirection, mindfulness, emotional regulation, or any other coping skill I’ve learned. I might suggest some journaling or something simple that can assist her with processing everything. Unfortunately, it seems like nothing she learns ever sticks. Either she doesn’t think of it, doesn’t believe or trust it, or just doesn’t put it into practice. She will often feel incapable of doing things that would probably help. It’s always a vicious cycle - she wants to feel better but the part of her housing that self-hatred holds her back from doing anything that might help for more than a day or two. It seems like she almost always tells me when she’s so “not okay” to the point of acting on suicidal impulses, which is a positive. I’m just afraid that one of these days I might not be able to help enough. I’ll always be there for her, so if I have to I’ll just continue doing what I can. I know ultimately the long-term change has to come from her, but I’d like to know if there’s anything more I can do. She also refuses to go inpatient again because her grandparents have custody of her daughter, and any indication that she’s “unfit” to be a parent will invoke them to withhold custody for even longer (one of the situations which contributes to her depression).</p>

2048.0,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x00000184EBEFAFD0>,,SuicideWatch,"How can the man who has it all have nothing left at all? It’s a question I ask myself every day, I even put it in a song I wrote.

3 years ago I was a drug addict who worked on a ranch and did Uber eats on the weekends and still couldn’t pay rent. I was a 20 year old kid with no friends, no girlfriend, no future, and no money. It’s not that I had no friends they were all just addicts like me, and my old friends, people in smaller towns, weren’t as receptive to addicts as larger cities. 

I took a job in April of 2018 and within 3 years I was on the board of directors at a top 20 company in the world. Which comes with great benefits like, incredible insurance and coverage, WAY too much money for one person, 1 month PAID vacation PER YEAR, free hotels and travel during working days work related or otherwise, but also, few days off, long drives every week, 50k miles on my truck within a year, strained relationships, mental health abandonment, sleeplessness, and stress like you could never imagine. 

But on October 14th my whole world came down and I tried to take my own life. My uncle and grandfather died within a week of each other both from overdose. Then a week after that my girlfriend breaks up with me, my best friends are moving for work and I’m alone. So on October 14th at 7:42pm I took 18 klonopin, downed a bottle of Don Perignon, and drank all the beer in my fridge. I was laying on the couch thinking I’d be scared or sad or nervous but I was at complete peace and so happy to finally end my life. Abby, my ex-girlfriend, found my note online and sent it to my friends and family. If my friend would’ve shown up one minute later I wouldn’t be here. But honestly, I don’t want to be. Why does the man who have it all have nothing left at all. Because everyone treats him the guy with a cross eye, his friends , his family , his girlfriend, his coworkers. The man who is regarded as one of the most brilliant minds in his field, still working directly with THE smartest person in the field who gave him a shot. Is constantly being coddled and looked at like a loony person for what he’s done. I’m still a successful man, I’m still a caring man, I’m still a Christain man, I’m still a man period. I’m a successful man who was unsuccessful in trying to kill himself and failing, not just a man who committed suicide. 

So long story short tonight I’m gonna buy some expensive champagne, drink it all by myself with a dinner of all my klonopin and finally end it, I was never meant to be happy, i was meant to die like this, peacefully and alone.

If anyone finds this and actually reads it just know I love you and you couldn’t have helped me. I’ve never said my real name on here but fuck it. I’m sorry for what I’m gonna do tonight but I love each and every one of y’all, especially you Abby Marie😍 you mean so much to me even if we don’t have each other right now, love William. ❤️

Today is the day after I posted that message. I fell asleep shortly after writing that from all the alcohol and klonopin and woke up WAY later that next morning. I’m not coming to tell you not to, I’m not coming to say you’ll regret it (you won’t you’ll be dead), I am coming to say to hold on. Why twice now have I been spared? Why twice have I been left to live? There’s a reason and a purpose and I believe (narcissistically I know) that some people are expendable. People are out here for a reason and that’s to help others, it could be one it could be thousands but if you try and commit suicide and succeed like I can’t, maybe you’re helping someone close to you that needed the pain to grow. But i know now I’m here for another reason, a greater reason than what I’ve already done. I’m still gonna donate, my brothers still gonna be put through college, but there’s a stupid quote by Daniel Tosh that says, “Money can’t buy happiness? Have you ever seen someone frowning on a jet ski?” I can say honestly, no, I haven’t. But I’ve seen more than enough rich people cry in their sports/foreign cars. 

So, I’ll leave y’all with this, don’t judge suicide, don’t tell them it’s something theyll regret, don’t talk them into being a bad person, every suicidal person needs a friend, every single fucking one.

EDIT - I am not here for pity, nor to stress anyone out about my decision. The last thing I want is to hurt more people with this- I do not want to be a burden either. I’m here to share my words. Though you are so appreciated, and I am in tears with your kind words, my goal was to just share my note. Thank you for understanding. 

To everyone - 
Quite sincerely, there is no other route to go about this. I have expended far too much time exhaustedly, unduly assessing how to properly deliver my note. An unethical abundance of queries has arisen and engulfed my mind as to what I should incorporate, as well as the configuration of my writing. Although I have no notion of how whoever is reading this is feeling, I can certainly imagine. I have no alternative but to get straight to the point. The modifications and doubt that has unfolded into a prodigiously overbearing weight on my shoulders while composing this have become too ample for me. I am going to write truthfully, wholeheartedly, and an exceptional amount. I have spent weeks mulling over whether or not to write a longer note, maybe a short statement? To maintain it solely brief and pure. Possibly not even leave a note. Though I can no longer evaluate these stressors, so here we go. 

One person doesn't have to read this note in its entirety-it isn't necessary. I can only endeavor to understand how mortifyingly detrimental this is for anyone. Let me prepare this for you. I’ve composed this in categorized sections, so you can discontinue when you feel the desire to. I wrote this with an infinite amount of tenderness, warmth, and sincerity. I’m sorry. 

I know the people I love will be upset with me, which you have every right to. But I am content now, for everything I felt deplorable about is behind me now. It's over, and this newly begotten peace I've to lead myself to will surely glue these pieces of my life whole once more. I’m certain for many of you, this was beyond unexpected, and I am sorry. Periodically I believe my life was consumed by utter dismal until I see the people I cherish. My family, friends, classmates, teachers, and even strangers I’ve met. I would not be who I am without them. So I thank you. I am so sorry, for I know the suffering this will bring you all.  Everyone in my life provides me with an endless amount of support and kindness. All I ask is for forgiveness. I don't need pity. Just forgive me, please. I'm begging you. 

This is no one's fault, besides from my own. You couldn't have done anything, because I didn’t say anything. I never spoke up, so no one knew and that was my preference. I did this to myself. But this is what I’ve longed for, so don't be sad. I don't want to hurt anyone, though at this point it's inevitable, so obtain yourself a better friend, daughter, sister, and student. I'm sorry I couldn't beat this. I've put this off for excessively long now, and I concede the pain it will cause, but I’ve cleared my lifetime of strife and sicknesses.

I want to convey my rationale and justify myself, but I assume I will never be capable of assuring anyone this was the appropriate decision. Nor can I intellectually defend my decision. Although now I have misplaced everything that was once within my grasp- there’s no one to condemn besides myself. Now, the act of killing myself is not due to impulse. I wish I was eloquently spoken, but I have been very sick. I can’t take this anymore. I know you will be angry-the unspoken lingering thoughts as you read on, the uncertainty and concerns flooding your mind. Allow me to reassure you. No matter whom or what, you could not have stopped me. 

You’ll soon learn to live without me. I tried my best, to stay afloat, but soon enough my strength gave out. 

Self Reflection - 
The Pollyanna in me yearns to believe my life will get better. I have undertaken every tactic surpassing me to understand myself, and what I’m about to do. I have undergone far too many occurrences of suicidal thoughts that have exceedingly nudged me over the edge, but this week was unprecedented. How narrow-minded of me, to elaborately illustrate my past desolation. The problem is, I am happy. However, I cannot escape my suicidal propensities. 

I hold no contritions nor compunctions to my name while writing this, only sadness because of the people I'm going to hurt. 

I know you anticipate me to pour my heart out into this, and I wish I could, for there's so much I would love to tell you, but it'll only make this worse. I’ve had my experiences which no one will ever know, I had innumerable goals, things I desired to do and create for myself, but the burden of your torment is too much. 

Goodbyes - 

Mom
This was not your fault. I did this to myself, you couldn’t have stopped me. We had our good moments. I tried to be good to you. We wanted to get along, but it doesn’t always work out. I’m proud of how far you’ve gone to provide for me, and I love you. You cannot blame yourself, you have a life ahead of you and communities of people who need you. You have a son who needs you. We had a special connection sometimes that I won’t forget, like when you healed my self-harm and calmed me down. You have so much potential to be good, and do good, why are you wasting it? Please, wipe yourself of this fog that’s distorting your behavior and be the potential you can be. I love you very much. Take care of yourself. But I am not strong enough to keep going so, forgive me, and keep going for me. I love you so very much. You did everything you could for me.

I can’t help to feel selfish for wanting to end it, I’ve always struggled with suicidal thoughts and depression. (At least as far as I can think back and remember) I had good times and happy moments I think, but there’s always that lingering feeling of emptiness, I don’t think I’ve ever been truly happy. 

I tried and OD on sleeping pills and was hospitalized shortly after I turned 18.  It was a very traumatic experience because my family is very religious and when I got out of hospital I had to listen to all my aunts and uncles give me a piece of their minds, i remember being very out of it for days but lucid enough to feel everyones judgment, felt shame and guilt like ever before I was heavily medicated for while before I could get my life back on track I was on a very short leash. 

Since then I’ve tried being positive hoping one day it will go away I always worked hard to do “everything right”. And wait for things to get better. And I started wondering why? Why do I feel like this when I’ve e had a life is privileges and that’s when I decided to to try and pin point the culprit. I started to think it was my job I mean it was I. Retail so do tell so I quit. 

Problem solve you ask? No even after starting a new job. It’s had everything I wanted in a job I thought in my field very well paid great hrs only 4days a week…. And the best part, I could finally afford to start therapy and medication. 

Fast forward a bit less than two years not much has changed to the point I just feel like a burden even to my therapist because we tried changing my dose my meds and nothing made a significant difference at the point where i don’t see the point.

I quit my job, empty my 401k and started isolating only leave the house if I absolutely have to which made me feel better in a way but I know it’s not a sustainable way living, so I started thinking what I want to do what might make me enjoy life but I couldn’t think of nothing. 
 

So I decided to give myself time until recently when I had loved ones over and they kept interrogating about why I left my job and when am I getting one. What am I gonna do with my life when I run out of savings. It honestly made me feel worthless and reminded me that the holidays are coming.

I no longer fear missing out on life, regretting it or what happens after death. I fear failing it and having terrible physical consequences. I can't even remember the last time I felt happiness, perhaps when I was seven, because I do have a few happy memories from that age. From that time, everything went downhill.

Skipping school was my biggest problem, I hated going there, I had so much trouble with sleep, insomnia, focusing in class. After missing school for weeks, I had to take all the tests with the kids who were there, of course my grades were terrible. But besides that I never saw a future for myself, I had no dreams of becoming someone, having a happy life. When I got into HS my depression and insomnia got worse, I started thinking about suicide. I think I only attended 3 months of HS and got kicked out, because of my attendance. I went to another school, and to make a long story about my education short. I'm 22 and I have 9th grade education. My depression after dropping progressed, I stoped leaving my house for months, but still had contact with a few friends and cousins who were the same age as me and would go out once or twice a month they would sometimes tease me about not having any more friends, never leaving the house or having an education. When I turned 17 I completely isolated my self. I have not left my parents apartment for 3 years. Not for a minute. Not for anything, I just stayed in my 8 m2 room alone, sleeping during the day, and sitting by my computer at night never opening my black curtains. Only when I turned 20, my teeth had deteriorated, and I was in pain, so I had to go out to the dentist. It was actually a surreal feeling walking outside after 3 years of not being out. Now I only leave for a dentist or doctors appointment, witch is about once every 2-3 months. I hate going out. I hate seeing people, especially the ones my age, i feel so ashamed, embarrassed about my self. I'm such a worthless failure. A waste of space. It doesn't help that I live in a small town, so I fear meeting someone I used to know.

Why? 

I don't even know

I just don't see a future with me in it. I can't even imagine a year or two into the future, it doesn't feel like anything real.

I haven't applied to any colleges. I don't see myself in any career, no matter how long I think about it. It all feels awful anyway... I don't want to do this for the rest of my life. 40+ hour work weeks? Everyday except for 2 days?

I think it's a message. If I can't see myself in the future, it must mean I'm not in it.

I don't know the best way to take myself out. I have access to a gun, I guess when I finally reach my breaking point, I'll write a nice little note, take the gun, and drive myself somewhere where only the cops will find me. 

I don't know if I'll shoot myself in the car. That's messy. Maybe I'll just drive it somewhere that is nowhere, walk until I'm lost, and then do it. They will find me eventually, right?

I don't believe in anything after death so I'm not scared of the possibilities. I'm not scared of how it'll hurt others. It hurts right now, but I know I'll feel nothing forever, so it's peaceful.

I married this person who is like my best friend and i’m not attracted to him at all. In fact when I have sex with him I just want to get it over with. I don’t hate him but I think some part of me does.

Yesterday we went out on his birthday and had a really great day and seeing all the kids made me feel like I want a baby. So we were talking about it and I really want a baby (I think). I’m only 19 years old.

I still haven’t had sex with him, and he is really good to me. He looks after me, cares about me but I just don’t think I love him, and that’s never going to change.

I worry about getting to the point where I'm NOT ""strong"" like people have told me over the years. Cuz that's part of the problem, I don't want to ""be strong,"" but I have no other choice.

Here's the condensed version of my story:

Raised as an only child on welfare to a depressed single mother. In a dysfunctional turn of events, the man who had been stalking my mom raped her, she conceived me and he ultimately lived with us from when I was 4-15yrs not as a relationship, but because he owed her.

Emotional, physical abuse, emotional neglect. Resulting in C-PTSD that I was aware of until I was about 28?

College on an academic scholarship. Moved out at age 20. Supported myself with 2-4 jobs while going to school FT. Got into a dysfunctional relationship at age 23. Got pregnant during a breakup, got married, had 2nd child. During this time was bullied and harassed by in laws. Then getting emotionally abused by my husband. Realized I was abused as a child. Attempted suicide.

Worked really hard on recovery. Separated. Divorced. Now single mom with two kids. Had them live with their dad for over a year while trying to do my own trauma processing and deciding if I wanted to live.

Then dating a man during the pandemic who healed parts of me and I don't regret, but when it didn't work out he started stalking me and making threats. It ended with a protective order. Now I'm homeschooling my kids, no income and had to put strict boundaries on their dad who was triggering me with his attempts to still emotionally abuse me.

I feel like that doesn't fully exemplify the struggles of my life. But all the while, I have had no family members, best friend, etc. to support me (consistently). Some were there for some months of my life. I have coped without substances and I'm drained. I need help. I don't know who to turn to. How do I just meet new people and say, hey I'm a great person with a lot to offer...eventually, but right now I really need someone to love me enough to help me get thru life?

It is all just too much to think about. Too much that I just want to give up. I don't know if I'll get there. It scares me because I don't actually want to die. I want help. But my fear is that I'm the one who has to help myself. So if I'm suicidal that will just be the end. Nobody will be there for me. Why is there nobody who cares?

Once, after watching hereditary, I was recalling scenes from the movie because I felt horrified and I also was remembering him continuing to fuck, though I was really dry and didn’t want to continue having sex with him. I’m not sure if it can be qualified as rape and because of that I feel like I’m lying to myself and manipulating myself and people around me into thinking that I’m a victim. And because of that, I don’t know, I feel like I make up all this dissociation cases and don’t really want to kill myself and and I lie to myself and try to convince myself that I have a mental illness. Everyone with whom I had shared this problem advised me to go to the psychiatrist, yet I feel like I’m lying to everyone, including myself, that I was raped and that I dissociate and the psychiatrist would sense it and tell me that I’m a liar. Should I go to the psychiatrist? Would they make me feel like I am making things up?</p>

I don’t know what happens when you die, but my theory is that it’s just a black void. No emotion, no thought, it’s just “quiet”.

<p>I wake up everyday and sit in my room on my computer for most of my life. Rarely, I’ll go out to hang with whoever is available at the time. It just feels like now is the best time to do it, because I’ve got nothing to lose.</p>

<p>Now, I’m aware that I could get better. I could put in some effort and start seeing a therapist, get out more to meet new people, but I just simply don’t want to. I mean, part of me does, but it’s not enough to get me to actually do it.</p>

<p>I don’t know what happens when you die, but my theory is that it’s just a black void. No emotion, no thought, it’s just “quiet”.</p>

<p>I’m also aware that by killing myself, people in my family would be devastated and miss me. Call me selfish, but that just doesn’t make me want to stay. I don’t resent them, I don’t want this to affect them, but I certainly don’t want to live anymore.</p>

<p>I’m just so tired of living. It’s become increasingly exhausting each year, and I think it’s time I call it quits.</p>

I've wanted to clean my room for a while now but I just haven't. Like with studying. Or exercising. Or doing my laundry. I just haven't. I take good care of my cat, like her litterbox and food and cleaning out her cat fountain. Sometimes, though, I feel like I procrastinate a bit with her care too and I hate that. 

My cat has cancer. She's been eating less and less and right now she's eating practically nothing at all. She's stopped eating the fancy food I buy her and the gravies I put in it, and she's really nothing but skin and bones at this point. She doesn't have much longer. 

I haven't decided on this yet. I'm still trying not to think too much on this, but I can't help but think of how easier it would be to just pass away. I couldn't disappoint my parents if I was dead. I wouldn't have to worry about tests or social obligations. I wouldn't have to worry about cleaning or exercise or getting a job. I'd be dead and my cat would be with me.

Several months ago I almost accidentally killed myself. I wasn't trying to, and wasn't even thinking about it at the time. I had just pulled into the driveway, shutting the garage door behind me.

One of the reasons I haven't died yet is because I haven't figured out how I'd do it. Carbon monoxide would be fast, relatively painless, and most importantly a failed attempt would look like an accident. It checks every box I have for potential ways to go. I have a method now and that terrifies me. There have been days since that I've driven home, shut the garage door behind me, and sat there a moment, car still running, wondering wether I was going to kill myself or not.

2048.0,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x00000184EBEFAFD0>,,SuicideWatch,"I have had on and off suicidal thoughts for the last 6 years now. It was on during most of senior year of high school, off after graduating high school for about 1.5 years, and then on again for the last 3.5-4 years. I've never attempted before and don't have a date set, but I do know how I would do it, and I've been feeling worse these past couple months. I’m not in a crisis right now and don’t see myself attempting in the near future (I mean, I went 6 years so far without acting on my thoughts, and I don't really consider myself as an impulsive person), but I guess I just wanted to make this post because I feel like I need to vent, and it’s easier talking to strangers on the internet than people you know in real life. 

For over half of my life, I have had mental health issues. I've never been diagnosed with anything by a professional, but I have had symptoms consistent with social anxiety disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, mild depression, and OCD. 

These mental health issues pretty much took away my adolescence. In middle school and high school, I was known as the “weird, quiet girl” and didn’t really have many friends. I even sat alone during most high school lunch periods, and whenever I did sit with people during middle school and high school, I mostly just zoned out or daydreamed while other people talked because I didn’t feel like I belonged and felt like I was just sitting there to make myself look normal. I also didn’t go to school dances including prom because I didn’t have anybody to go with (not even a friend). The only school dance I've ever been to was this one annual middle school dance (it took place in the middle of the school day, so I didn't really have a choice), and I remember watching people dance and socialize while I sat down in a corner all miserable, uncomfortable, and alone. 

These mental health issues are currently taking away my twenties as well. Now, not only am I just as friendless as I was in high school, but I’m also a college dropout who’s still living with her parents and hasn’t done anything significant with her life in the last 3 years since dropping out (not even a job), which is such a shame because in high school I was a very studious student who got straight A’s even while taking a bunch of AP and honors classes. And honestly, I don’t think things are going to change for me because I have so much trouble adulting due to my mental health issues. Even though I'm in my early 20's, I feel like I'm still 12 years old. 

The best year of my life in the last decade was my first year of college when I met my first (and only) boyfriend, but even that came with a cost. After being together for over a year, he dumped me because I became too emotionally dependent on him (I increasingly treated him like a therapist as I struggled more and more in college). My sweet, kind, wonderful college boyfriend who pretty much felt like my soulmate dumped me, and it was all my fault. I was selfish. I opened up to him, but I never gave him room to open up to me. He did so much for me, but I did nothing for him. I relied on him so much, but I never really considered his needs. Even though I do not regret the time we had together because it felt so great, the cost was me finding out that I’m an incredibly toxic, selfish person who’s incapable of loving anyone (because love is selfless and I’m too selfish for that), does not deserve love, and is better off avoiding friendships and romantic relationships because anyone I open up to I’m just going to end up sucking the life out of just like I did with my ex. 

These past couple months, I’ve felt very lonely. During the summers, I usually enjoy hanging out with my stepfather’s family (it’s the only social life I have), but this past summer, it was not as enjoyable as it used to be. This past summer, whenever I saw my stepfather’s nieces/nephews and their friends hanging out together, it was like I was in high school all over again (people around my age socializing while I’m just watching from afar because I'm too socially anxious to join them). They seem like such a tight knit group, too. I remember one time I even saw one of my stepfather’s nephews hug a female friend who was having an emotional breakdown, and it made me feel lonelier than ever because I don’t have a boyfriend or close guy friend my age to hug me when I’m down. To make things worse, I have a crush on my stepfather’s nephew’s friend (mostly physical attraction because I’ve hardly talked to him). I even friended him on Facebook, but I unfriended him recently because he never seemed interested in me, I felt it was the only way to get me to stop Facebook stalking him, and, most of all, because I knew that even if he was interested in me that it would be a bad idea for me to get into a romantic relationship or even friendship anyways because I’m a toxic, selfish person with a lot of issues. Unfriending him broke my heart because I felt like I was giving up on all guys, not just my crush.

This past summer, whenever I saw my stepfather’s nieces/nephews and their friends hanging out together, it was like I was in high school all over again (people around my age socializing while I’m just watching from afar because I&#39;m too socially anxious to join them). They seem like such a tight knit group, too. I remember one time I even saw one of my stepfather’s nephews hug a female friend who was having an emotional breakdown, and it made me feel lonelier than ever because I don’t have a boyfriend or close guy friend my age to hug me when I’m down. To make things worse, I have a crush on my stepfather’s nephew’s friend (mostly physical attraction because I’ve hardly talked to him). I even friended him on Facebook, but I unfriended him recently because he never seemed interested in me, I felt it was the only way to get me to stop Facebook stalking him, and, most of all, because I knew that even if he was interested in me that it would be a bad idea for me to get into a romantic relationship or even friendship anyways because I’m a toxic, selfish person with a lot of issues. Unfriending him broke my heart because I felt like I was giving up on all guys, not just my crush. Now, I just hope that if he did notice that I unfriended him that I didn’t hurt his feelings because it isn’t his fault that I unfriended him.</p>

I was scratching my face and arms wanting to draw blood and kept smacking my head, with my hands and my phone, my phone screen was already cracked but I slammed it into my forehead so hard some new ones formed. Even now that I've calmed down I'm still angry I wasn't able to hurt myself more; I didn't bleed and nothing left marks. I feel weak for not being able to stomach cutting myself or holding my breath until I pass out instead. I think self harm is more common for me than I realize when I'm in a better mental state. Scratching and hitting myself, etc. As a kid I would choke myself until my vision started going spotty. I don't really know why I do it, I guess it feels more effective than screaming or throwing things. I don't want to cause a scene with sleeping people in the house but I am also desperate for them to see my injuries in the morning too. I want to pass out and have my family find me and feel shocked and sad without me actually dying. I want the outside situation to match what is happening in my head so maybe I would feel like people fucking care for once.

My doctor and therapist know I have anxiety. I think I have OCD too, and a handful of learning disorders (or maybe just one because symptoms overlap). I've had compulsions since I was twelve, and just recently started having obsessive spirals that I can't shake. I was sexually abused repeatedly at the age of five and between that, not having any sex education about consent and such, and being exposed to pedophilic porn at a young age my relationship with sex is not a good one. Most of my intrusive thoughts are sexual. I worry I'll never be a parent because I won't be able to protect my kids from sexual harm or worse, I'll become my abuser. I have a cat as an emotional support animal who is my whole world but I recently started having intrusive thoughts about her. It makes me physically sick to think about hurting her but my mind tells me I already have. It also tells me I wasn't assaulted because the person who did it was not an adult (and therefore not a pedophile so it was just another kid exploring right? And I wanted it? Even though I didn't consent right?) So I must just be a horrible person.

Up until the beginning of this year I had a really bad home life wherein I was constantly in a panic, living with my bipolar addict mom. Nothing against people who are bipolar or addicts but she refused to get help and always brought her skeevy abusive boyfriend around, and they always fought, over anything, sometimes over me and my mom even accused him of touching me (he didn't though of course I proceeded to have intrusive thoughts about it). My point is that even in this shitty time of my life I still had hope and thought if I stuck it out until adulthood I could achieve my dreams of getting married and being a parent. Now I'm living somewhere better but my mental health is in the dumps for no reason.

The littlest things can set me into a spiral where I convince myself I'm a terrible person who doesn't deserve any of the things that make me happy or that my dreams are dashed because 1) who would ever want a nutjob and possible offender like me and 2) I would eventually end up hurting my kids no matter what. I was super proud of myself for bringing my grades up from last year but I was sick for a week and now I have two failing grades down from 100 A's in that short time. Everything feels fucking hopeless and as always nobody sees me suffering or they take it as a joke. After the fiasco that was last year where it finally felt like my family was SEEING me, and SEEING the hell that was my life and they finally cared, now it's back to the beginning. Of course it was conditional because they think I'm an attention whore who hates them for not realizing that I was raped as a kid and not doing anything, they figured if they gave me a sliver of their time I might back off. I didn't hate them but now? Yeah maybe. Fuck them. Even things that prevented me from suicide before (like I'm the only one who takes care of my cat and they would probably send her to a shelter if I died, and I can't let that happen) are nothing because I feel like every fucking thing and every fucking one is better off without me.

But with this god damn short story pouring my heart out I know I still probably won't kill myself, not because I have a reason for staying alive but because I'm a coward. I'll just let my life fall apart around me and maybe start popping pills like my mom. I'm useless. And I have to wake up at 4 AM for school tomorrow. Fuck that. I'll try to make myself vomit so I can stay home again. I guess that's more self harm too.

Edit: I just genuinely don't know what to do with myself anymore. I feel deranged. I don't know how to move on even after making simple mistakes. I keep telling myself ""It's okay, just try not to do it again"" and ""Work to make the most of your life and make the world a better place"" yet everything I do reminds me of my abuser. How can I be a person? I can't even recover from something other people would not have thought twice about. Definitely still planning to skip school tomorrow. I can't do it.

2048.0,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x00000184EBEFAFD0>,,SuicideWatch,"Hello,

I've been making plans to end my life, concrete plans, and keep coming back to it all day. Core of the issue is that I hate my job and can't seem to find anything that suits my skill set - and haven't for years. My administrative day job is boring as hell, monotonous, repetitive, and very very slow. It pays something - it isn't like I'm working at Wendys flipping burgers. But it's drastically misaligned with my abilities and a position for which I'm way overqualified. I may even soon be automated out of the role.

I'm 43 and newly married, to a great woman, and financially we are okay right now, but in the area of work I'm desperately unhappy. I feel she deserves a whole person, not a half person, and right now I'm a half person. She wants a baby. If she gets pregnant, there is no way one of our incomes will support her ability to stay home, which is what she desires should that happen. 

I had a very competitive west coast job, just out of college, years ago, and one that was tailored beautifully to my skill set. I fucked it up completely - not because I couldn't do the work, but because a crackpot doctor put me on meds at the time that made me psychomanic and caused psychotic episodes. That's when I was 21. I got through it, found meds that were 99% effective, and found work in another sector, but suffered from severe fallout trauma related to what had happened (including a dramatic loss of confidence) - and have never been able to find a successful road back into that sector despite numerous attempts to do so.

Today this person in my professional network stabbed me in the belly, told me he is starting a company that is perfectly tailored to something I can do, that very few other people can do - but when I asked him for details, he turned on me and said ""that's top secret."" But he requested SEVEN YEARS of notes that I took on a related project, that cost me $300,000! (The guts!) To me this was assholish behavior, and it left a rotten taste in my mouth all day long. To be honest it was the straw that broke the camel's back.  I thought I'm sick of this bullshit. Something like this always happens when I go out on a limb professionally. It proves the old adage: some people are absolute pigs.

I've gone back to school, I obtained a professional certification (two) to make me more hirable, but I'm not even sure i'll be good at the related work. Still, I persist in applying to these roles - day in and day out. And most of the time, people are so callous that they don't even send me form rejections. I've spent over 7,500 hours over the last 3 years, in fact, applying, and interviewing, and occasionally networking, and it has gotten me nowhere. I'm very, very tired. And marriage or no marriage, I'm about out of energy. My wife deserves better than me. 

So I found a painless suicide method that is pretty quick and easy and will only cost me about $44. 

I know she will feel devastated when they find my body, but I also am confident that she'll get over it and move on, to date someone who can give her everything she needs and deserves. I know my family will get over it as well.

<p>I&#39;ve been making plans to end my life, concrete plans, and keep coming back to it all day. Core of the issue is that I hate my job and can&#39;t seem to find anything that suits my skill set - and haven&#39;t for years. My administrative day job is boring as hell, monotonous, repetitive, and very very slow. It pays something - it isn&#39;t like I&#39;m working at Wendys flipping burgers. But it&#39;s drastically misaligned with my abilities and a position for which I&#39;m way overqualified. I may even soon be automated out of the role.</p>

<p>I&#39;m 43 and newly married, to a great woman, and financially we are okay right now, but in the area of work I&#39;m desperately unhappy. I feel she deserves a whole person, not a half person, and right now I&#39;m a half person. She wants a baby. If she gets pregnant, there is no way one of our incomes will support her ability to stay home, which is what she desires should that happen. </p>

<p>I had a very competitive west coast job, just out of college, years ago, and one that was tailored beautifully to my skill set. I fucked it up completely - not because I couldn&#39;t do the work, but because a crackpot doctor put me on meds at the time that made me psychomanic and caused psychotic episodes. That&#39;s when I was 21. I got through it, found meds that were 99% effective, and found work in another sector, but suffered from severe fallout trauma related to what had happened (including a dramatic loss of confidence) - and have never been able to find a successful road back into that sector despite numerous attempts to do so.</p>

<p>Today this person in my professional network stabbed me in the belly, told me he is starting a company that is perfectly tailored to something I can do, that very few other people can do - but when I asked him for details, he turned on me and said &quot;that&#39;s top secret.&quot; But he requested SEVEN YEARS of notes that I took on a related project, that cost me $300,000! (The guts!) To me this was assholish behavior, and it left a rotten taste in my mouth all day long. To be honest it was the straw that broke the camel&#39;s back.  I thought I&#39;m sick of this bullshit. Something like this always happens when I go out on a limb professionally. It proves the old adage: some people are absolute pigs.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve gone back to school, I obtained a professional certification (two) to make me more hirable, but I&#39;m not even sure i&#39;ll be good at the related work. Still, I persist in applying to these roles - day in and day out. And most of the time, people are so callous that they don&#39;t even send me form rejections. I&#39;ve spent over 7,500 hours over the last 3 years, in fact, applying, and interviewing, and occasionally networking, and it has gotten me nowhere. I&#39;m very, very tired. And marriage or no marriage, I&#39;m about out of energy. My wife deserves better than me. </p>

<p>So I found a painless suicide method that is pretty quick and easy and will only cost me about $44. </p>

<p>I know she will feel devastated when they find my body, but I also am confident that she&#39;ll get over it and move on, to date someone who can give her everything she needs and deserves. I know my family will get over it as well.</p>

3 years ago I was a drug addict who worked on a ranch and did Uber eats on the weekends and still couldn’t pay rent. I was a 20 year old kid with no friends, no girlfriend, no future, and no money. It’s not that I had no friends they were all just addicts like me, and my old friends, people in smaller towns, weren’t as receptive to addicts as larger cities. 

I took a job in April of 2018 and within 3 years I was on the board of directors at a top 20 company in the world. Which comes with great benefits like, incredible insurance and coverage, WAY too much money for one person, 1 month PAID vacation PER YEAR, free hotels and travel during working days work related or otherwise, but also, few days off, long drives every week, 50k miles on my truck within a year, strained relationships, mental health abandonment, sleeplessness, and stress like you could never imagine. 

But on October 14th my whole world came down and I tried to take my own life. My uncle and grandfather died within a week of each other both from overdose. Then a week after that my girlfriend breaks up with me, my best friends are moving for work and I’m alone. So on October 14th at 7:42pm I took 18 klonopin, downed a bottle of Don Perignon, and drank all the beer in my fridge. I was laying on the couch thinking I’d be scared or sad or nervous but I was at complete peace and so happy to finally end my life. Abby, my ex-girlfriend, found my note online and sent it to my friends and family. If my friend would’ve shown up one minute later I wouldn’t be here. But honestly, I don’t want to be. Why does the man who have it all have nothing left at all. Because everyone treats him like a guy with a cross eye, his friends , his family , his girlfriend, his coworkers. The man who is regarded as one of the most brilliant minds in his field, still working directly with THE smartest person in the field who gave him a shot. Is constantly being coddled and looked at like a loony person. I’m still a successful man, I’m still a caring man, I’m still a Christain man, I’m still a man period. I’m a successful man who was unsuccessful in trying to kill himself and failing. 

So long story short tonight I’m gonna buy some expensive champagne, drink it all by myself with a dinner of all my klonopin and finally end it, I was never meant to be happy, i was meant to die like this, peacefully and alone.

If anyone finds this and actually reads it just know I love you and you couldn’t have helped me. I’ve never said my real name on here but fuck it.

I exist in a community at my college. It's meant to be welcoming. The leading people there say ""if you're ever struggling with suicidal thoughts, please, come to us,"" but when you do come to them they label you as an attention seeker and ridicule you. In my situation they invalidated my feelings because someone else (who's social status is higher than mine) was also having hurt feelings about our situation.

We are both hurt. I don't know what I did to them, and they won't tell me. But apparently they are telling other people in our community, and I am still left in the dark.

The people who I thought were my friends left me. They thought I was trying to start drama when I privately messaged one of the leaders to discuss the situation, and they brought it up to other leaders, despite the situation being me asking a mundane question.

It hurts. It's been hurting for months now and I thought it would get better but it doesn't. They all chose the other person over me, but I don't want to make people choose. I believed we could coexist, but apparently that just isn't possible. They hate my guts, and their feelings are valid.

Then I took my belt, wrapped it around my neck, and closed it (it was one of those that had a buckle, easy to snap down and up).

I saw myself in the mirror, I saw my face turning purple. Eventually it hurt, and I undid the belt out of cowardice.

There is now a mark on my neck. I did research on asphyxiation, and it did not seem like a good way to go. My neck and head have been hurting ever since.

But I want to try it again. I don't want to go back on it this time. I want to lay there, let my face grow purple, and have the belt dig deeper and deeper into my neck. I feel as though it would hurt less than continuing with this painful life.

I restarted to think about various ways to kill myself lately. i could go up to my dad right now and tell him but i know he would brush it off just like last time. i have several painkillers in my bag,thinking about ending it all tonight. sorry</p>

Im just gonna write my story here because honestly, I don’t want to live on anyway so I’m not gonna do anything about it, even though I am scared of dying. 
Starting off at the beginning of my life my father abused me as an infant all the way until I was 5 I think. 
I’ve always been rather alone and I preferred it that way. I recently got diagnosed as schizoid which explains why I’m not interested in pretty much anyone’s life at all or having friends. I struggled with depression, self harm, anorexia and bulimia throughout my teenage years and got better when I turned about 18 through therapy. Then I met my ex-boyfriend who abused me both mentally and physically for the majority of our 2 1/2 year long relationship. He broke up the night I punched back for the first and last time. He wanted to stay friends, let me come over one night and raped me. I’m a much smaller and lighter guy than he is. Since then my emotions pretty much vanished. I used to cry a lot before and been very emotional sometimes. My anger issues started when he started abusing me and they just got worse. I never hurt anyone other than him and myself. I self harm a lot and deep. My arms look like I stuff them into a meat grinder for fun or my best friends are bears. I like the way I look, but I think to others I just look like a crackhead or an overall failure. I don’t really mind. I think I failed my life or life has failed me. I can’t focus in university, I can hardly feed myself or pay my bills. I’m really alone and even though I‘m fine with it, I wish I had someone to love. Someone who’d make me want to stay alive for them, but as stated before I don’t have it in me to try and get to know people especially because I think if I really open up about myself, people get scared of me or think I’m disgusting. Even here I don’t want to say why, but it’s true. I wish I could tell someone who feels the same and likes me back maybe, but I doubt it’ll ever happen. 

Farewell ppl maybe I’ll return idk yet. I can’t feel my arm rn, just the blood pressuring against the puncture in the vain or the tendon getting irritated bc I’m using my thumb. I can’t get myself to go to a hospital bc I have ptsd and get panic attacks when they put me into a locked ward. My dad and ex used to hold me captive. Im just scared man

2048.0,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x00000184EBEFAFD0>,,SuicideWatch,"Here is my story for context (I just turned 18 a week ago, I am male and in first year University)

I have been very socially isolated through grades 4 through 10. The end of grade 10 was when I first fully self harmed (I help a lighter to my shoulder and fingertips until the skin crackled).this was a few weeks after the suicidal thoughts became frequent.  Since then I tried out different types of self harm. After that I began to slowly increase the frequency of the self harming. (I switched to cutting). 

Grade 11 I was at my new school and had a pretty decent social life. However the feelings stayed. although the self harm decreased slightly. Then the summer hit and I was alone again. The self harm suddenly become so I couldn't go 12 hours without cutting. Whenever I would cut I would get like of like a high and the mental pain would ease. I think I got addicted to this or something because if I went a period of time without it I would feel a bit shaky and the places I cut itched.

Half ways thought August I was at a campsite with my family. I went for a walk in the dark at night. I ended up taking some rope with me. From there it is a bit blurry but I just remember tying a noose, looping it over a tree and then well, black. When I came too, my neck was burning and my ribs felt like someone had kicked me in the chest. There was a man standing over me dialing his phone (I can presume to be 911). Panicked I reached out and I grabbed his phone and threw it on the ground. I then got up and ran. I ran back to our tent and lay there until morning. In the morning I told my parents I was feeling sick and we went home. I still feel like a piece of shit for breaking someone's phone who saved my life.

From there things got worse for a bit. I began to cut so much it was all I could think about aside from ending things. Then in November I started going out with this amazing girl. I was able to keep the cuts from her for a while, until one day she noticed. She was very upset, but she was there for me. Although I don't think she completely understands the constant pain and aloneness I feel she is always there for me. From there I was able to reduce the amount I cut until I only did it every few months. However the thought never eased

Now I still feel incredibly alone except when I am physically touching her. The only thing that keeps me from ending things is her, because I know how much it would hurt her. However I feel scared to bring it up with her because I don't want to drive her away or to make the relationship just about this issue of mine. Few things give me joy, almost all I think about is dying. Two weeks ago she had to talk me out of slitting my wrists (something she should never have to do) so she took my knife. However I want to cut so badly to ease the pain. The only other thing that eases the pain is working out. However I can't do that all day so it isn't a solution.

And what makes things even worse is I am in engineering, I have almost straight A's. I have an amazing girlfriend. I am in excellent physical shape. So I feel like i shouldn't be this way because of those things, but I am anyways.

I don't know what to do. She is the only person I can talk to about this (I can never tell my parents it would make things worse and I know this for sure) but I don't want to scare her away. I also don't know if it is serious enough to warrant seeking help. And if I did get help I am scared of getting medicated so can't function anymore.

I don't know how much longer I can hold out against full time cutting and/or ending it, the urge to do both is getting stronger and stronger. I am running out of options.
