505,do things ever really change?,Easythrowaway1256," title is the basis for my issue. i've typed a bunch of different things to post that i never have and had this thought in general. does it ever actually get better? for the most part, i hate myself. if i could pinpoint a time that it felt like everything in my life shifted, it would be college i guess, but there was a couple years period of time that i just really don't like who i was, felt like a bad person, had bad things happen to me, just things in general were the worst and idk if that actually shaped who i am today, or if its just a bag of things that happened that don't actually matter but i just know that i used to be a super imaginative, motivated young extroverted kid, and now i find myself as a miserable 31 year old who is introverted with no motivation and a ton of confidence issues. part of that is obviously my own fault, giving into bad habits, not having friends, etc. but i would always kind of tell myself to just focus on me, eventually it will happen for me, i'll find someone, but just focus on yourself and be happy. to an extent, it did somewhat work, i had a period where i said yes to everything, found some new motivation, and pushed myself out of my comfort zone. i got in the best shape of my life, i had a lot more friends, i was traveling outside of the country, generally felt like i was ""out"" in the world more....and yet, everything persisted. i just found myself feeling super alone around friends, or super alone on vacations, or outside of the country, realizing that while i had done cool things, nothing had ever changed, i still felt as shitty as normal, i was still completely alone, and still am. then it goes to recently. i was convinced that where i lived was a major problem. all the friends i had were moving far away in the state (3+hours), getting married, or leaving the state all together and the friends i was traveling with lived in another state. well i wound up getting laid off from my job at the start of covid, and through a crazy event of circumstances, i got an offer and compensation to move there and decided fuck it, i'm 30 but why not do it? well it was kind of stupid, i am now in a place i have some amazing friends, and have been brought into the group from my mutual friend in the group. but everything has still been very different with covid. i've been here for about 1.5 years, and i've explored practically nothing. i've had zero dates, and again, i feel completely and utterly alone. i can't discuss it truly with friends or family back home because they want me to be happy and moving home wouldn't make me happy. i can't tell my friends here because same thing, they want me to be loving it here, but i'm not, hopefully its the pandemic, but idk, its been tough. and then i have all this thought about it even being worth it. i don't feel i want to live here forever, but i also don't want to lose all these friends i've made here who i think are good people for me to have in my life. then i worry about how to date seriously here if i don't plan to live here forever, family is important, but what if they care more about their family than mine and would never move? do i just waste years on that? or how does it change my entire family dynamic if i never moved home? that feels incredibly sad too? idk, i'm obviously rambling now, i could go on forever, but the point being that despite ""changing"" the base feeling of complete shit has literally never changed. telling myself it will happen for me eventually is obviously not true, because it hasn't, and never will, and i don't know if i'm just destined to never find anyone and just be purely alone. it just feels like something that will never actually go away and it kind of has me scared that this ""life"" i have is the life i'll live for the remainder of my life and that really fucking sucks.",1.0,1.0,Depression,do thing ever really change title be the basis for my issue I have type a bunch of different thing to post that i never have and have this think in general do it ever actually get better for the most part i hate myself if i could pinpoint a time that it felt like everything in my life shift it would be college i guess but there be a couple year period of time that i just really do not like who i be felt like a bad person have bad thing happen to me just thing in general be the worst and idk if that actually shape who i be today or if its just a bag of thing that happen that do not actually matter but i just know that i use to be a super imaginative motivate young extroverted kid and now i find myself as a miserable 31 year old who be introvert with no motivation and a ton of confidence issue part of that be obviously my own fault give into bad habit not have friend etc but i would always kind of tell myself to just focus on me eventually it will happen for me ill find someone but just focus on yourself and be happy to an extent it do somewhat work i have a period where i say yes to everything find some new motivation and push myself out of my comfort zone i get in the best shape of my life i have a lot more friend i be travel outside of the country generally felt like i be out in the world moreand yet everything persist i just find myself feel super alone around friend or super alone on vacation or outside of the country realize that while i have do cool thing nothing have ever change i still felt as shitty as normal i be still completely alone and still be then it go to recently i be convince that where i live be a major problem all the friend i have be move far away in the state 3hours get marry or leave the state all together and the friend i be travel with live in another state well i wind up get lay off from my job at the start of covid and through a crazy event of circumstance i get an offer and compensation to move there and decide fuck it I be 30 but why not do it well it be kind of stupid i be now in a place i have some amazing friend and have be bring into the group from my mutual friend in the group but everything have still be very different with covid I have be here for about 15 year and I have explore practically nothing I have have zero date and again i feel completely and utterly alone i can not discuss it truly with friend or family back home because they want me to be happy and moving home would not make me happy i can not tell my friend here because same thing they want me to be love it here but I be not hopefully its the pandemic but idk its be tough and then i have all this think about it even be worth it i do not feel i want to live here forever but i also do not want to lose all these friend I have make here who i think be good people for me to have in my life then i worry about how to date seriously here if i do not plan to live here forever family be important but what if they care more about their family than mine and would never move do i just waste year on that or how do it change my entire family dynamic if i never move home that feel incredibly sad too idk I be obviously ramble now i could go on forever but the point be that despite change the base feeling of complete shit have literally never change tell myself it will happen for me eventually be obviously not true because it have not and never will and i do not know if I be just destine to never find anyone and just be purely alone it just feel like something that will never actually go away and it kind of have me scar that this life i have be the life ill live for the remainder of my life and that really fucking suck,0

435,i feel so alone in my plight. my eyes are probably going to shit and no one can help me.,glennglog22," for months now i've been dealing with this and this last month, things have gotten so worse both mentally and physically. new visible symptoms have shown up and it's making me worry greatly, but there's fuck-all i can do about it. i'm a poor early 20's college student living in a household that isn't very affluent, so they can't help foot the bill needed to stop this. i got with a non-profit and on the 8th, got with an eye doctor, who then told me i had very healthy eyes and that i just have dry eyes and to use otc eye drops. it's been a few days and i've found that not only have the eye drops have done nothing for me, the symptoms have worsened (peek through my profile if you want to know exactly.) i'd hope one would reasonably assume and agree with me that it may not ""just be dry eyes,"" but nobody agrees with me. one person in my house thinks that eye doctor's opinion is absolute, the end-all-be-all. i feel like i could be dying and he'd insist i'm fine though. i've had to learn the hard way multiple times that fact and yet i still continue turning to him and leaving feeling like my opinion is invalidated. i've went to the er twice and they couldn't do anything for me because they never have the equipment. it's been a huge pain in the ass to get with a free primary care doctor because of their requirements and the timeframe. i called one and was told that the soonest appointment for a new patient would be the end of january. i feel i don't really have that time. by then, things may very well have gone to shit by then. it gets worse by the week, or even the day. it feels like i've been buried alive in a coffin slowly filling with sand and i'm being told on the phone that help is 4 days away. i'm desperate. i've cried more times this month than i have in years. all i just want is either for it to stop or at least to just have answers from anywhere except google, have a second opinion from another doctor. my condition seems mysterious because it all matches the description of glaucoma, retinopathy or retinal detachment. dry eyes don't cause these things, do they? i feel, as i've said in the title, alone in this plight. household members are either non-understanding, unsympathetic, or unsure what to do with me. even friends that do sympathize with me are unsure what to do with me. if my eyes do end up fully going to shit, it will affect my livelihood, because i work with computers and to do that, i need to be able to see. also a lot of my social interactions are online and if my vision does go to shit, i won't be able to interact with my friends and it'll become lonely. i don't want to live in a future where i can't see. because i can no longer stand to stare at my computer screen, i've missed several assignments. i can hardly distract myself anymore now without my eyes giving me reminders via visual anomalies that they're (probably) going to shit.",3.0,1.0,Depression,i feel so alone in my plight my eye be probably go to shit and no one can help me for month now I have be deal with this and this last month thing have get so worse both mentally and physically new visible symptom have show up and its make me worry greatly but there be fuckall i can do about it I be a poor early 20s college student living in a household that be not very affluent so they can not help foot the bill need to stop this i get with a nonprofit and on the 8th get with an eye doctor who then tell me i have very healthy eye and that i just have dry eye and to use otc eye drop its be a few day and I have find that not only have the eye drop have do nothing for me the symptom have worsen peek through my profile if you want to know exactly id hope one would reasonably assume and agree with me that it may not just be dry eye but nobody agree with me one person in my house think that eye doctor opinion be absolute the endallbeall i feel like i could be die and he would insist I be fine though I have have to learn the hard way multiple time that fact and yet i still continue turn to him and leave feeling like my opinion be invalidate I have go to the er twice and they could not do anything for me because they never have the equipment its be a huge pain in the as to get with a free primary care doctor because of their requirement and the timeframe i call one and be tell that the soonest appointment for a new patient would be the end of january i feel i do not really have that time by then thing may very well have go to shit by then it get worse by the week or even the day it feel like I have be bury alive in a coffin slowly fill with sand and I be be tell on the phone that help be 4 day away I be desperate I have cry more time this month than i have in year all i just want be either for it to stop or at least to just have answer from anywhere except google have a second opinion from another doctor my condition seem mysterious because it all match the description of glaucoma retinopathy or retinal detachment dry eye do not because these thing do they i feel as I have say in the title alone in this plight household member be either nonunderstanding unsympathetic or unsure what to do with me even friends that do sympathize with me be unsure what to do with me if my eye do end up fully go to shit it will affect my livelihood because i work with computer and to do that i need to be able to see also a lot of my social interaction be online and if my vision do go to shit i will not be able to interact with my friend and it will become lonely i do not want to live in a future where i can not see because i can no longer stand to stare at my computer screen I have miss several assignment i can hardly distract myself anymore now without my eye give me reminder via visual anomaly that they be probably go to shit,0

95,"suffering from what i believe to be depression for about five years, haven't told anybody.",Puzzleheaded-Job5763," i have been experiencing symptoms of depression ever since seventh grade. i believe that this mostly stems from my lack of self worth and my potential eating disorders. in an attempt to place a veil on my depression to the outside world, i portray myself as a happy, outgoing, and charismatic guy, when in reality it is simply a character that i have built to portray myself as somebody that i am not. through this character, i have been able to become what some would consider popular in my high school. i get a fist bump or a high five from quite a bit of people when walking down the halls, nobody has picked on me ever since i built some muscle, and i can't think of anybody who doesn't like me or who has an issue with my persona. while my life is no more difficult than the average joe's, i continue to go through worsening symptoms of depression. not a day goes by where i don't contemplate suicide, and the psychological torment that i go through by overthinking physically and mentally drains me. on my worst days, i will catch myself in the middle of class with a lump in my throat and my whole body shaking from the anxiety that someone will notice that i am on the verge of crying, and only one of two outcomes will occur: option one, they ask what is wrong and i have to open up to someone for the first time (i still have not told my parents about what is going on, and i am a senior in high school preparing to move out for college); or option two, the individual who notices makes a joke about it and worsens the entire situation. both of these options are unfavorable, so i keep my head down and say that my allergies are acting up or i didn't get enough sleep. recently, all of the symptoms i have been undergoing for the past five years have significantly worsened, and on top of that, i recently got sick with the common cold and had to miss a few days of school, adding unnecessary stress and fatigue into my life. this makes it a lot more difficult to portray the charisma i have been fronting this whole time. to add a new layer to this mess, i have been binge eating and gaining back a lot of weight that i lost in the past few years (i went from \~200lbs to \~135lbs, now back up to 170lbs in the past couple of months). luckily, i don't think anyone has noticed this weight gain, as i lift weights so instead of looking like a dough boy, this additional weight has a muscular appearance. even if nobody else may notice, i already had severe body dysmorphia, so adding a single pound to my frame, especially thirty five of them, is not helpful to my mental state whatsoever. because she is a wonderful person and has helped many of my friends with their own personal battles, i have been considering scheduling a meeting with my guidance counselor for the past few years just to open up to someone, but i have never had the courage to actually do it. simply because of the way i was raised, it is very hard for me to reach out for help. my father always talked about depression as if people suffering with it were ""nut cases"" and should be locked away in an insane asylum, which even furthers my unwillingness to inform my parents of this dilemma and ask them for advice. i do everything that most self help books and therapists would tell me to do anyway. i am very active, as i lift weights and recently joined our school's swim team, i eat healthy, i typically avoid drugs (while i do enjoy a toke every now and then), and i meditate. truly, i am completely lost and don't know what to do anymore. my grades are suffering and my anxiety is increasing with my apathy towards all of the things i used to love. if this doesn't get better, i worry i will one day do something irrational.if anybody out there actually took the time to read this in it's entirety, any advice or guidance would be greatly appreciated

790,"my story, lookimg for help",ProfessionalGoat2905," hi, im 19 year old male from europe.and im having a hard time understanding myself and  my situation, basically where should i go from here.lets start...i have both parents and i got basically everything in life. my own room, food and im mostly healthy.my childhood was good. i was their single child until my brother came. and they raised me well, i was loved and looked after, maybe even too much haha.then school came around and i was extremely tall skinny kid with big ears who was a main target for all bullies. i was bullied daily in school, musical school, basketball club and of course i tried to defend and i fought back which ended up getting me beaten at home cause those kids told their parents and their parents called mine and they didnt understand that i was bullied nonstop, but insted they saw the problem in me fighting those kids to end the bullying. bullying continued and i was instructed to just ignore them. and basically my confidance was 0.next phase is when i found out about porn and masturbation, when i was 11. i found a porn channel on tv and i was hooked instantly. that was my cure for all the bad feelings i got from school. i started jerking off everyday, even got a blackberry phone to buy new porn. then came video games. and i was always more on introverted side, espwcially with new people, with friends i felt comfortable around u talked alot. but i always had fear of girls, i was terrified of any interraction with any girl i liked even a bit. so i always just tried to escape those imterractions.i went through whole highschool without much interraction...i kissed a girl for the first time sin a game of truth and dare🙃 there was some awful situations where girls literally came up to me and asked me why am i so shy and i couldnt even say anything back, i was so embaressed. i always thought of myself as a very ugly being and i didnt liked looking at myself in the mirror(i still dont)and finally i met a girl through tinder and again i was so shy that we texted for 3 months before we met each other, cause i was scared. she was a bit older but i found her very cute(i mean even if she wasnt that good looking i would still be down, i longed for any girl attention basically) and we met and she told me how fucked up life she had and i was like i wanna help(cause she has like mentall condition bpd, bipolar..) and i fell in love, like completely, i was like a puppy. doing everything she said, gifts, flowers... it was just too much.. we had good time that summer but we didnt have sex for multiple reasons(1)she had an std that she needed surgery, 2) i was really scared even tho i would give out anything for it,3) after i told her about my porn addiction she wanted me to get off it first for few months4) when she jerked me off i couldnt finish and she thought thats fucked up5)some guy tried to rape her and she got flashbacks when i got on top of her one time...) i know, a total mess, but u know what..i was madly in love and i didnt have clear vision.fast forward...i went to college to different city and we started arguing, after one year we broke up over texts...i was utterly depressed whole summer, didnt study shit, lost a year of college.by the end of the summer i was drinking and smoking 5g daily. i came from fit basketball player to a total trashed pothead.now im in different college, i have a gambling problem(i literally spend all the money on slots and online games, by saving up on food and college material), porn addiction(but not any porn- only sissy/forced bi/gay porn with lots of humilistion)i watch 6 hours of porn daily and jerk off at least 3-5 times. idk why i just cant stop. if i do i get noticibly more agressive and agitated, cant concentrate. and i cant even get hard for regular, vanilla porn...i go out and just get trashed, like two timws a week.i feel like shit all the time, and i cut myself sometimes, ofc wanting to die.i felt so low at one point when i was technically still in relationship, that i got on grindr and got fucked every night for a month by complete strangers.i feel so unworthy of snything, im so disgusted with myself every time i cum i just fall deeper into despair and depression. i hate my own being so so much i cant even describe. i cant even talk with girls now because all i think about is that i got fucked in the ass and how gay that is...and therefore i shouldnt be with any women ever again. and i feel so uselessidk what to do, im just falling deeper, if i had more

559,should i address this again at the psychiatrist or just leave it??,anonymous_account111," some background information: everyone in my family has or has had depression and many have been or are being medicated for it, too. my dad's an alcoholic. i first expressed suicidal thoughts at age 6 and went to a children's psychiatrist. was fine til age 12. got chronically ill at age 13, have lost a vital organ which i'll have to substitute until the rest of my life. got an eating disorder which i still have. was gaslit by many doctors. one of the symptoms of my illness is literal depression. also weakness, fatigue, hair loss, anxiety, loss of libido, sleep problems, always feeling cold, muscle and joint pain, constipation,... basically living in the body of a 70-year-old at age 13. so i've had depression since before i even knew what it was. i had to live life somehow because i thought that's just how i am. graduated school last year (was bullied and often times dismissed by an ableist teacher). and i still did good in school. i have always considered my self high-functioning because i didn't know how else to do things or that there even is another way.    since then i feel like i've had major depression. covid didn't help. spent 99% of my 18th year of life at home (which i was almost glad about). started taking sleeping pills and felt like now i know for the first time in my life why people like to go to bed. went out once a month only to get drunk without feeling like a loser for doing it alone. then i went home and self harmed. my mum and aunt put a lot of pressure on me and told me i was wasting my life away. turned 19 this year. had a 10-hour-a-week job for 5 months but i couldn't do it. my hair started falling out and i realised i'm really, really limited in terms of what i'll be physically able to work as in the future. thought about my life and everything and only then i realised i'm really, really sick. psychically and mentally. and that everything's super fucked up. after 6 months of enduring every day and night and wasting away, i enrolled into uni and found myself a psychiatrist because i realised i either do this or will kill myself for real.   it's very hard to get treated for a mental illness where i live. i only got to become a patient at this psychiatrist's office because he only opened it this year so he didn't have many patients yet. but that also means he sucks. he really sucks. i went to the appointment and told him everything. and that i have every symptom of major depression, basically. and that i think about suicide every single second of the day. or that this is appointment is the first time that week that i went outside and only because it's my very last resort. i couldn't do anything anymore. i didn't love anyone, not even my twin sister who is the only person in my life who really understands everything we have both gone through, even our illness. and i used to love her so, so much. but every single person and day and activity and morning and happy music and sunny weather annoyed me and i couldn't take it. i either felt nothing or cried. he made me uncomfortable (just one example: when i told him about my frequent self-harming, he asked a question in which he used a word which i very often associated with making fun of self-harm in my language and made a suggestive gesture at his arm??). but i was glad he described me a very needed antidepressant.   then i looked at his diagnosis and he said i have _moderate_ depression. i asked him why he believes so and then i heard one of the most stupid statements ever said: ""well basically, only people who are in clinics can have major depression."" ????? and also that if i had major depression, i couldn't even have showed up to the appointment in the first place.maybe this sounds stupid and, i mean, at this moment in time everything that counts is that i am being medicated. but i have had depression for so long and have fought hard to be where i am today so i would've at least liked to not get gaslit again and have an official and correct diagnosis. or am i even in the wrong here??

that never felt like as much as a problem as the should have been. but now that i'm forced to go without them basically all at once, i can feel the damage that they've done to me. at this point, i might actually be dying.going without pot has been very difficult. i am a very long term very frequent smoker going without for the longest period of time since i started smoking. of all my addictions, thc has been most effective and making me feel less hopeless and depressed, while not being very helpful at addressing the problems that make me feel hopeless and depressed. now going without it i'm in a lot of physical and emotional pain without the 'escape' button i'd usually have to get out of it. i reflexively think that i can go for it now and then, but it simply isn't there to turn to now and likey won't be any time soon due to current circumstances.i'm going through nicotine withdrawal. my personalized habit is persistant and unrewarding, but hasn't felt as damaging as it could be. but whether it feels damaging and actually is destroying me are two different things. i'm pretty sure that i've set myself up for an early death from all my time spent smoking. but all that time spent smokng is very hard to replace. going without tobacco leaves an enourmous void in my life which is the time i would normaly spend taking care of the habit.equally significant to those other habits, i'm going without my perculiar addiction to coca-cola. so whether it's withdrawl to sugar or caffine or carbonation or decocainized coca leaf extract, i'm feeling that very badly right now. my addiction to coke is pretty extreme. i usually drink at least four cans a day and hardly ever drink straight water. but now in short time going without that, i feel the consequences of abusing my body so badly. it feels like diabetic shock. and my kidneys are probably ruined too.on top of that, i've had noticable swollen lymph nodes for a couple months now. for all i know i have lymphoma and lung cancer and a brain tumor all at once. that's just about how i feel right now.so latey, i've been feeling suicidal without the desire to actually bring an end to myself manually. but after all the abuse i've put my body through over the years, seems like i won't need to do that dirty work after all. or at the very least, if i'm actually dying it wouldn't hurt as much finishing myself off

818,i can't pull myself up after being ghosted by my best friend,GracefullyClumsy_," to explain this,i have to go a few months back:so i (25f) met this person online through a band we both liked.we are also both dancers and bonded over that, so we started a project within the fandom for which we choreographed a number to one the band's new songs.all was well and even though we live in different countries, we made it work.we got really really close and after a few months we decided, i'd spend my summer vacation at their home town, so we can finally meet in person.we spent an amazing week together and were even closer afterwards.i have never been this emotionally true with anyone before.receiving the same amount of love and effort i give back was completely new to me.we were texting, calling or video chatting 24/7 for several months.they were recovered from an eating disorder, which i knew, and were handling themselves quite well.a few days after i left they were assaulted, which triggered a relapse.long story short:it went on for weeks and i did my best to be there for them.listening, distracting, coming up with strategies for them to get themselves to eat and drink and reassuring them when it didn't work.i never blamed them for not living up to self set goals or breaking promises.i always reminded them of how loved they are by the people around them and that they weren't in this alone.yet they got worse and worse every day up to a point where they would pass out multiple times a day everyday from malnutrition and dehydration, even have seizures at night and their s/o checking for a pulse every couple minutes (don't ask me why no ambulance was called, i genuinely don't know)..i was convinced they were going to die.so i told them, i could not just watch from far away, i wanted to come over ( it's just a 55min flight) they asked me not to, since the thought of me going through all that trouble to be with them would increase their anxiety and they wanted to make a change anyway, so i wouldn't need to worry.i agreed to stay put after they contacted a psychiatrist for them to see within the next two weeks.two days later we are on the phone and they are breaking down, telling me they see no more sense in fighting it and they didn't have the energy to keep holding on.i was convinced they were not going to survive another weekend and got on that plane.the moment they knew i hit the ground, i got ghosted.it hurt. it's been four months and it still hurts like shit.i started to self harm and have had an anxiety attack almost every day since then.we had so many plans for the future together - every single time we had a few days off for 2021 we planned on meeting. fall holidays, my birthday and new year's eve.we wanted to move in together to a different country after they finished their training in two years.suddenly all of that was just not going to happen.my friends and family have been amazing through that time, but seeing me like this is also really hard on them. i feel myself rejecting them and being mean to them, when the thoughts get really bad.here comes the fun part: that project we started isn't finished yet and we have a lot of people involved who have absolutely no idea what went down between us and still think we are best friends.so we might or might not still have to work together eventually.i work in childcare and i do believe i used to be very good at it.now i just really despise going to work at all.i have no energy to pretend to be fine every single day, which has my coworkers talking.i don't dare to call my friends anymore, because they are all so tired of hearing me complain.i am terrified of going on with my life, because i still don't really understand how we could fall out like that after being so close.i try so hard to figure out what i could do differently next time to have a different outcome, but i can't come up with a solution.i don't trust myself.i don't want to keep breaking down crying in my bathroom every other day.i can't even maintain a smile.i used to be so smily.the only reason i put off ending things is, because i know what it would do to the people around me. to my mum, my friends, the kids at work.they don't deserve this pain.but i don't want to be responsible for them.i don't want to be responsible for anyone any more.i just want out.",1.0,0.0,Depression,i

29,the silent murderer killing my soul,Jstock673," why do i constantly feel like everyone around me is turning their backs to me? i know my family cares about me and they don’t want me to be depressed like this. but i’ve gotten to a point now where i feel like it is inevitable that i am going to feel like i want to die everyday. most mornings i wake up, get ready for the day, and i feel good like the depression is gone for a few hours. then someone will say something to me or look at me the wrong way and i’m right back to where i was. when i’m down here everyone looks at me like i’m a monster who is just seeking attention, treating me like a weak child, helpless and pathetic. then i start to feel like i’m getting in their way of joy and happiness. as if any situation that i become part of brings chaos and insanity, no harmony. i feel like that chum the shark hunters throw overboard to attract them. it is so true that predators feed off the weak. i am gay and i came out when i was 14 because i wanted to live an authentic life. i am now 39 and i do feel like i’ve learned how to be honest and loyal in this life, but that is really all i can say. people just don’t give honesty as much value like i thought they would have. in fact it seems like being honest and real has only made me more vulnerable, weak and alone. today i fantasized about dying and then being a ghost so i could finally see all the true ways that people are deceiving me. we live in a dark world full of lies and deception. all of the happy happy joy joy is fake and makes me want to puke these days. it's sick what religion does to people. i feel like this depression i am in now is not self induced. i just got out of one of the most mentally abusive relationships i've ever been in. he basically made me feel like i am worthless. i think he was a true psychopath, and there is a lot more damage that he did that i'm not even aware of yet. all he made me feel like i was good for was some sex. he chewed me up and then spit me out. then when we broke up he tried turning it around and saying that i was the one using him for sex. he was very aggressive when it came to meeting new people. he was cuban so he had that social butterfly effect, which is the complete opposite of how i am. i met him back in 2011 but we only went on one date, and then i dumped him. then in 2019 when we met again he looked a little different but tried to act like he wasn’t the person i met back in 2011. he is just one of those guys who thinks he knows everything about everyone. i hate to blame being suicidal on someone but i really feel like this is where he wanted me. when he found out i was on medication for depression i could almost see the gears starting to turn in his head by his reaction. it gave him some kind of advantage over me. he has turned the gay community here in fl against me, even the closeted community. i just cannot understand how i could be more depressed now in my life than i ever have. i am on good meds that work great. i see a wonderful therapist. i have been clean from drugs and alcohol +cigarettes since 2014. i have a lot to live for but i literally went shopping for rope today. i won't do it until after christmas for the sake of my mother and my family. hopefully these malicious attacks on my spirit and soul will stop and i will change my mind.just thought i'd add that i think

605,today has been a totally weird day. timing has been on point!,scorpnet," so, this is a true story of the events of today! december 7 2021. the day is not yet over so who knows what else could happen before i crawl into my chamber to take sleep for the night.   this day has been very weird with timing, i mean very weird. so far, 3 events that seem innocent by themselves have happened in the span of around 12 hours.   1.) good call on blood work!  so, some context. i have been off work for a bit over a month. just got home from a long vacation. i had a telehealth appointment while on the road, and the doc ordered some blood work. no problem, i can do it when i get home. i chose to get the work done monday as i did a bunch of crap over the weekend. now, i had contacted my pcp to see if she needed bw done as well, get it all done while i was there, which she responded yes and told me she sent the order over in the system. so i did my fast sunday night, and arrived yesterday morning at the hospital. now, where i live the hospitals up here are of the same company as my doctors who are in a totally diffrent part of my state, yet thier computer systems are not synced up as of yet. i didn't realize this so the bw of my pcp was not at the hospital. i had called to have them fax, but the office staff there do not seem to be quick. so i dind't get any bw done yesterday.   fast forward to today, after calling secveral times to my pcp i decided to just say screw it, get my other bw done and just get back to work to make some money. this is where it gets weird. i started my truck to get it warm, and as i started to put on my boots my phone rang. its from my dermotologits office. i was not expecting to hear from them at all. and what did they want? you guessed it! requestd me to come in for some blood work! i had told her i was literally putting my boots on to head to my local hospital to do just that for another doc of mine! she emails me the order and i was able to get it done.   2.) arriving home at the same time  so, today is a day of doctors for all of us here at my home. my dad had the first appointment at 0900 and left the house at about 0730. (we live in the boonies and our docs are usually 90-120 minutes away.) he was not expected home until around 1100. well once i got my derm's paperwork in hand i waited a bit longer for this electrician to arrive at the house, he had work to do at my moms request, and i did not want to leave him here alone with her, plus she had a doc visit too that she had to leave around 1200 for. i have no idea what time i left the house, i didn't look, my bw could be done at any time. when we realized the electrician would not arrive in time, or at all, i just left and headed to the hospital. now, my hospital i went to was only a 15 minute drive, no big deal for me. i waited a good amount of time, i have no clue how long i was not paying attention, got the work done and left. stopped at the gas station, got me 2 monsters and left for home. i made no other stop, i did not look at the clock, i didn't call anyone, i just drank my monster (yayy no more fasting! caffieene!) and enjoyed the ride home. next thing i know, as i am pulling into my driveway, my dad was pulling in right ahead of me. he literally arrived at the house at the exact same time as i did. weird odds!  3.) the anchient picture  so this one, my mom thinks that my grandma is around helping us out. context time: theres this giant wall sized painting of a mountain range of what i could only assume be central utah. its beautiful, i personally love it. my grandmother and my mohter never really did. well, this painting was in the family since the 60's or 70's before i was born. it hung at my grandmothers house for the longest time, and when we moved to our current house, for some reason it came with us. don't ask me, i was only 14 at the time, and an ignorant teen. anyways back in 2000 is when it got put up and hung on the wall and that is where it stayed every single day to today! now, my mom hates it, and she has plans on stuff to replace the picture with the wall. her first problem was getting rid of it, which there was no issue, since my uncle said he would take it and keep it in the family. so after several years of her aquiring this special wood to make shelves out of, and certian figurienes of her favorite animal, the time has come to finally replace the painintg. tomorrow was the day dad and i were to take it down, while my cousin comes up and installs the shelves. well, about 2 hours ago, as i sit in my room i hear a bang!

812,i had a (minor) depressive crisis,SoullessSaviour,"  ## my mental health took a surprisingly depressive turn recently.i had a minor crisis last saturday evening — a depressive bout of feelings of inadequacy, worthlessness, and blinding fear about the direction of my life. it came out of nowhere and i stopped what i had been trying to write and just broke down. the house was empty. i was alone.i went to the roof to have a cigarette and clear my mind. i had already had two inscrutable breakdowns and, because i was alone, had no one there to comfort or temper me. while up there, i had what i thought was a clear epiphany but, in hindsight, was probably a figment of my battered and starved ego. i rushed to finish my cigarette, giddy and breathless, sure that i had figured out the first step in the direction of happiness. downstairs, under the blinding fluorescent lights of the bathroom vanity mirror, i took the clippers to my healthy beard and cut it down to a heavy stubble. i could already see how weird this was going to turn out, but i kept going anyway. i shaved my entire face down to the skin — the first time that i had done so in over four years. it was a fatal error. let me tell you something: the beard makes the man. period.**i 👏🏽 looked 👏🏽 terrible 👏🏽**i expected to look surprising and strange, but years younger with a youthful glow. nah. my skin was blemished and unhealthy, i looked like i had progeria, and, for the first time in my life, i *felt* my age. i knew i had fucked up. i said so many times to myself as i paced around the bathroom trying to make sense of what i had done. i was pathetically reduced to depressive tears again before the night was out. it sucked. i sucked — i was sure of that. and i hated myself. i hated everything about me.## i have always been prone to bouts of self-deprecating depression, especially when things in my life are not going the way that i expect.my expectations are pretty high and maybe that’s something that i could try to change right away.something good did come out of this though — a blessed opportunity — thanks to my woman, whose loving guidance i cherish. she taught me how to take care of my skin and correct all of the issues that i had with it — some that i had not realized i had been complaining about for years. it’s been a week and i look at least three times better already. when she came back that night, we had a good laugh about my surprising transformation, but it wasn’t enough to keep me from feeling dejected and spiritless. she propped me up and made sure that i took a break from work, social media, and all stressors the next day. it was fantastic. by the end of that second night, i felt refreshed with new perspectives, ideas, and inspiration going into sunday. it was … *transformative*. i think i’ll be taking a total break at least once a week now because it really seems to get the creative juices flowing.depressive episodes like this don’t always make sense, and they can seem to come out of the ether, entirely unprompted and without warning. if i understood them, then i would not be suffering from them anymore. the only thing that seems to keep them at bay for extended periods is doing the things that i love and being with the people that i care about.writing and family. they help.what else can?

(despite my fear of them.) and it didn't do much. i thought maybe it was burnout, so i took a vacation with friends. did nothing.  very few things make me feel happy. i used to play games very frequently, nowadays i have a giant unfinished library of games to play, and i might finish two or three in a year. nowadays i can't even get through a game that feels genuinely interesting to me. i used to draw for hours and hours at a time, and now i can barely do 15 minutes a day. i used to watch a lot of shows but now it's all kinda of boring. i just feel like i can't be excited about things. i used to spend time studying a variety of things and working on projects but i can't find that passion that kept me motivated anymore. hanging out with friends are pleasurable, but it's not exciting. at one point i really enjoyed sex, but even that i'm kind of bored of and not even excited for.  while i'm not in any kind of danger to anyone or myself. i'm just a bit surprised since i see peers always excited about something. and i can't seem to be able to get excited for anything. i searched up on google, bored with life and it gave me a suicide hotline number. so i'm here trying to see if this is possible a form of depression and maybe i should go see a psychiatrist about it.

246,this year everything i built up in psychic resiliance broke together,Captain_Cackwurst," i'm 25m. had a shitty youth and was thouroughly depressed at \~20. i changed some things, did therapy and somehow things turned for the better and i had the (so-far) best years of my life with 22 to 24, where i learned that it was possible for me to be contempt and stable with my life. i would say i was happy. now something seems to have broken inside of me and i try to recall what i've lost that made me happy.to recollect some things: at the end of last year, i felt that a lot of people were crumbling around me. two good friends of mine broke of their studies and became burnt-out/depressed, another became depressed too, another broke up with her bf and was (is!) in a constant state of mourning. i tried to be there for them but felt the pressure it put upon me. i felt like everyone else but me and my gf was declining in mental health. then in spring i noticed for myself (i recently reread it in my diary) that i felt that my own 'happiness' was about to crumble. weirdly prophetic. then in may my gf broke up and naturally i felt like shit, but i figured that it was this break-up that put me down and i still had a good summer in hindsight. i had to engage a lot however with stories of people with severe psychological disorders for my job, and i fear that might have taken a toll on me too.since november it's a steep downward spiral. i was jobless for a while and had too much time on my hand for thinking and stuff. the little dating life i enjoyed in summer broke together and now i have no chance of seeing anyone, i get no good match on my stupid dating apps anymore and i think i'll stop using them. i constantly try and fail to stop smoking. in the loneliness - and this has happened the whole year, not just this summer - i feel like 'bad thoughts' poison my mind, especially contemptuous thoughts against women. i know these thoughts won't help me anywhere but downwards, but i don't know how to help them\*. i feel like my body gets older and i'm wasting my youth. my political beliefs also changed significantly in the past two years and i feel like i lost connection to some former good friends because of this, one friend especially told me that she might terminate the friendship if i wasn't a 'leftist' anymore.fortunately i still have a bunch of good friends, and i'm good at making friends (well at least when i'm not so bitter as of now), but i still feel like i'm alone with a lot of my 'darker' thoughts and feelings of remorse and guilt. i'm considering phoning my old therapist and ask for a few sessions, but i will only have time for that in february. it's just a big bummer i've fallen back into a lot of old habits of depression and old habits of thinking about things. i am kind of afraid that it will still get worse, or that it will keep being like this for a while. i know i could be much worse off though, i only had suicidal ideations a few times this year and i was filled with that back when i was 20. \*one thing i am trying to help with this is making more female friends (without any thoughts behind friendship). but generally (being heterosexual) it just feels easier to talk about my loneliness with guys..",0.0,0.0,Depression,this year everything i build up in psychic resiliance break together I be 25m have a shitty youth and be thouroughly depress at 20 i change some thing do therapy and somehow thing turn for the better and i have the sofar best year of my life with 22 to 24 where i learn that it be possible for me to be contempt and stable with my life i would say i be happy now something seem to have break inside of me and i try to recall what I have lose that make me happyto recollect some thing at the end of last year i felt that a lot of people be crumble around me two good friend of mine broke of their study and become burntoutdepressed another become depressed too another break up with her bf and be be in a constant state of mourn i try to be there for them but felt the pressure it put upon me i felt like everyone else but me and my gf be decline in mental health then in spring i notice for myself i recently reread it in my diary that i felt that my own happiness be about to crumble weirdly prophetic then in may my gf break up and naturally i felt like shit but i figure that it be this breakup that put me down and i still have a good summer in hindsight i have to engage a lot however with story of people with severe psychological disorder for my job and i fear that might have take a toll on me toosince november its a steep downward spiral i be jobless for a while and have too much time on my hand for thinking and stuff the little dating life i enjoy in summer break together and now i have no chance of see anyone i get no good match on my stupid date apps anymore and i think ill stop use them i constantly try and fail to stop smoking in the loneliness and this have happen the whole year not just this summer i feel like bad thought poison my mind especially contemptuous thought against woman i know these thought will not help me anywhere but downwards but i do not know how to help them i feel like my body get older and I be waste my youth my political belief also change significantly in the past two year and i feel like i lose connection to some former good friend because of this one friend especially tell me that she might terminate the friendship if i be not a leftist anymorefortunately i still have a bunch of good friend and I be good at make friend well at least when I be not so bitter as of now but i still feel like I be alone with a lot of my darker thought and feeling of remorse and guilt I be consider phone my old therapist and ask for a few session but i will only have time for that in february its just a big bummer I have fall back into a lot of old habit of depression and old habit of think about thing i be kind of afraid that it will still get worse or that it will keep be like this for a while i know i could be much worse off though i only have suicidal ideation a few time this year and i be fill with that back when i be 20 one thing i be try to help with this be make more female friend without any thought behind friendship but generally be heterosexual it just feel easier to talk about my loneliness with guy,0

998,does anybody else love but hate the finale episodes of tv shows?,ThaProtege," like looking back at that 70s show finale and how the credits were the same as the first episodes and all that happened in the show itself. or the finale episode of futurama and how they went through life together in a pause world, just to be offered a chance to go back without memory and doing it all over again and they do it. knowing that shows history and my own personal history (relationships, people i watched the show with, etc) with the shows and episodes also bring nostalgia. or the fresh prince of bel-air finale where everyone is in the house in the end scene, everyone going their own ways and starting their lives while will stays in california and the college but the lights being turned off and the pan of the house. or the friends finale episode where everyone is moving on and going their own ways too, with the finale pan of the apartment.like i love the finale episodes because they have a lot of meaning behind them and a lot of them time shows conclusions on things we've been watching through the whole series and the episodes are usually good and sentimental. but damn is it an emotional thing too. i'm already not the biggest fan of nostalgia because it just makes me miss a certain time period/frame, usually giving me emotions of family,  old relationships and friends and realizing i can never go back to rhat time, i can never relive those moments and i could never feel that same energy again and the fact i will never be the same, that i'm only getting older and in some ways things were better back then (mentally, financially or whatever). it just brings on a lot of fear for an indefinite and questionable future, and a lot of pent up emotions, doubts, worries, feelings and memories. on the other hand nostalgia is great because it makes you remember those times, even though that's not always helpful or beneficial. but overall it sucks knowing we won't be able to ever relive that and feel that again. only memories (that may or may not sta) and feelings. but seeing the characters in shows going on to live their lives does make you optimistic in ways but then you realize it's just a show and then you see these actors and actresses in reality, completely different people, doing completely different things and in completely different places, some don't even remember the show they acted on, which makes you realize the emotions you have about the finales and shows aren't all that important, you feel stupid for caring about those emotions so much but then they are just there now. we know we'll never see characters again, we'll never know what happened to the characters after the finale, we'll never know where their paths are now, where the relationships went, what else was done and seen. like there's so much possibility and it just seems too open. like yes, shows are an art and arts usually are meant to have open interpretations but honestly it's just not enough sometimes. a lot of people love the fact that people are choosing their own storylines for characters after the show, but me, i want something canon and legitimate, not just assumptions, even if it is just a show. finales definitely are a complicated but simple thing, especially if done correctly. what do you think about finale episodes in

434,when is it my turn to be happy?,FontSeekingThrowaway," apologies for the long post.covid has taken a toll on my (24m) mental health - so much so that i have officially been diagnosed as depressed and have gotten medication for it. i only recently had the courage to reach out to the doctor to get this diagnosis and medication, and while it's helped a little it seems like every little bad thing will set me off.i think everything bad started for me in september of 2020. since may of 2019, i had been away from my university on an internship. i believe that the last day of that internship (august 31, 2020) is the last time that i have truly felt like myself. i had friends that i spent time with regularly and was well liked by my coworkers. that all changed when i went back to school.classes were held online for both semesters (september - april). while that pales in comparison to in-person classes for most people, it was particularly difficult for me for two reasons:1. because classes were held online, it felt like there was an expectation to be at your computer more often. i remember sitting in my desk chair from 9 am from 9 pm most days (with breaks) and also working on the weekend to finish up my assignments.2. 2. i was alone, or very close to it. most of my friends had graduated the year i was on my internship, so i didn't have a very good support system. i had one friend in most of my classes, and i asked her to check in on me every once in a while to make sure i was alright since i knew that something was off with me. she did for a while but eventually stopped. it's also very difficult to make friends when all of your classes are online, so i couldn't really make friends even if i wanted to (which, of course, i did). going out to meet people was also not an option since the pandemic was particularly bad in my area, forcing most in-person events and venues to close.to satisfy my urge for social interaction, i turned to tinder. i met up with a few women and enjoyed their company, but eventually things fell apart with them. more often than not i would get ghosted. i did end up in a brief relationship with someone i thought was great, only for me to put in 90% of the effort. it took me a long while to get over her, especially because i didn't really get any closure until i reached out to her about 9 months after we broke up (she moved to a different city and returned for school). i did feel a lot better after getting the closure i needed, but it upset my girlfriend at the time because she wasn't comfortable with me seeing my ex (i understand her point. she knew i was going to but just not when. i didn't want to tell her because i was so anxious. i told her right after i saw my ex and she was very upset).eventually, after that failed relationship, i used tinder mainly to hook up for a while. i did find someone that i got along with really well (our first date was 31 hours long!) but eventually she told me that she wasn't in the mental space for a relationship right now, even though she did want to eventually want to be in one with me. we kept chatting after that until she ghosted me. this one didn't hurt so badly because i knew that she wasn't ready and that we weren't actually in a relationship.at the same time i was talking to this woman, i was also talking to another one who eventually became my girlfriend. she was pretty shy but warmed up to me eventually. what i really liked about her is how much she cared for me and was concerned for my mental health and wellbeing. things were great at first but eventually they started going downhill. i tried to be there for her as best as i could, despite my mental health, but there was just so much to deal with. her family had a lot going on. one particular item of note was that i attended my first funeral with her - and it was a murder-suicide. that took a lot out of the both of us.things were also getting bad because i had signed up for two commitments before we started dating and was just not getting the time to work on them because i would always be spending time with her. i clearly said that i needed my space but she always convinced me to be with her instead. (i know, partly my fault. i'm an adult who could have said no. but i digress). that meant the work just kept piling up and i was getting more and more stressed. i started taking things out on her - just being short tempered and not really wanting to help her out. i feel awful about that. eventually it got to the point where our relationship was basically me coming over for the evening, we watch netflix after i asked if she wanted to talk and she'd refuse, us going to sleep and just before we slept she wanted to talk, me falling asleep because i had a long day and was exhausted (eventually i made a rule that if we were going to talk i would stand up so i wouldn't inadvertently fall asleep), her crying herself to sleep, repeat. it was awful and took a serious toll on my mental health. that wasn't the only major stressor in that relationship. as i mentioned, i don't really have any close friends. i struggle to maintain relationships out of business, or i would always be initiating conversations and activities with people who would only respond half heartedly or would ghost me. as such, i don't really have anyone that i can reach out to. and i don't want to scare away new friends by opening up about all of my shit right away. i did have one close friend who i've known now for about three years. we've been friends on and off - mainly it's been her disappearing. i did reach out to her in december of 2020 and we had been chatting, but it was probably not until july of 2021 that we started hanging out again. it was great - i actually had someone besides my girlfriend that i could talk to and open up to. when i would have relationship problems, i would vent to her.unfortunately, our friendship ended recently. i had always intended for my girlfriend to meet her but it just never worked out. for some reason my girlfriend had a hang up about being friends with people who worked in the same mall as her?? she was starting to get over it, but by that time we were fighting a lot. i didn't want to introduce my girlfriend to my friend while that was going on, so they never actually met. so my friend and i would hang out. the last time i saw her, we went to a bar. it was a lot of fun - the time really flew by. she had a lot more to drink then i did. after the bar closed we got some mcdonald's and just sat in my car and talked. she was very vulnerable because she opened up to me about some serious stuff. she then told me that she found me really attractive at that moment. i turned her down by saying that i wouldn't cheat on my girlfriend, but i did (and i know i shouldn't have) but i flirted a bit with her.  i then went home to my girlfriend, who was waiting for me. she was upset that i hadn't texted her (i was paying attention to my friend and when i'm out i generally don't look at my phone). we fought for about an hour before falling asleep. the next day, my friend felt guilty and decided we had to end our friendship. i understood but was reasonably upset. i wanted to talk it through with my friend first to see if we could talk things through before i opened up to my girlfriend about what happened (a bad decision, but i didn't want to be forced to cut off my friend. i know now that that was wrong). but that wasn't the half of it. i was texting with my friend about it, and before we had ended our friendship i was talking about that i was unhappy in my relationship and was considering leaving for my mental health. my girlfriend broke into my phone while i was sleeping and saw the texts. she confronted me at like 4 in the morning, and we fought for a bit before she dumped me (understandably). i went home at like 6 am before going to work. we kept talking over the course of the day before making up and temporarily getting back together. i don't know why i agreed to, maybe just because i wanted her comfort? who knows.what was really messed up is that she texted me ""i found out that you were mostly telling me the truth"" when i told her what happened the morning we broke up. i asked her how she knew. it turns out that she went to my friends work (who she had never met) and confronted her about it! my friend decided (understandably) to cut me off. i got back together with my girlfriend for a couple weeks, but losing my friend really hurt me - especially since i barely have any friends. my mental health took a nosedive after that. i knew i had to break up with my girlfriend. i just couldn't forgive her for losing me my friend, besides the other issues we had. i was actually concerned that i would end up in hospital because of a suicide attempt had i not broken up because i was just so miserable. once i broke up with my girlfriend, i waited a few weeks before reaching out to my friend and apologizing for what happened. she never actually accepted it, and ghosted me. that made me sad all over again.now you might ask yourself, what about your family? i still live with them but plan to move out in the next few months. the problem is is that i've never really fit in with them. it's always felt like it's been my sister and parents are one family, and i'm a guest in the house. this has gotten worse over the course of me being in university (6 years). they don't ever invite me to do things and they never really talk to me. i know they love me but they could show it a bit more. i feel like a guest in my own house. i've tried to take the initiative but it seems like we have nothing in common. my sister is always out and my parents are always watching netflix. if theyre watching something and get interrupted, they get upset. i want to improve my relationship with them but i just don't know how.the one light in my life is my job. i worked at a terrible place for 3 months right after graduation. i was gaslit and generally mistreated. i have since moved on to work with their competitor. i'm a lot happier. the issue is that my mental health is starting to affect my work. i've gotten slower and it's been pointed out. i don't know what to do and i definitely don't want to lose my job.so in summary, here's been my life since september of 2020:-ghosted by a close friend-no real friends to speak of-two failed relationships-no improvement in family relationships-terrible job followed by great jobi know that people say that things will get better eventually, but i'm just having a hard time

i dont want to be a factor for someones own life. its too fucking scary. it was a nightmare. i hate thinking so deeply about the world and meaning and life and being fucking shit at it. im just so sad but i have a little spark in me that still wants to pursue and comeback. its just all too much. i just want to wake up one day and just not panic every thinking second. tl;dr: adopted kid has no personal or racial identity and is trying to deal with the struggles of it. first semester of college i saved a persons life from suicide and it gave me ptsd and an existential crisis. i continued college and failed the next 2 semesters. i havent told my parents yet and i am petrified and ashamed.",3.0,2.0,Depression,insane vent m19 i be adopt at 3 month from kazakhstan to my awesome family my mom and dad r both white but I be a dark skin asian i struggle so much to find any identity in myself racial or personal i do not want to learn about anything kazakh even type the word out make my chest tense up and burn i hate be adopt i wish i be just my parent kid not some orphan with zero clue about their origin i do not want to look into it it terrify me i also fail all 3 semester of college and still attend my school i have not tell my parent yet bc I be so fucking ashamed of myself i have no excuse i just do not do any work i could not handle all the lonely night i could not even eat bc i be so scared to interact with ppl my depression be horrible to help cope with it I have be look into philosophy to find a higher truth to this world and realize that nothing matter besides what you make of it how bullshit be that I be scar of meaninglessness I be horrify by death i hate my life so much i just want to succeed but i can not fight my demon about my adoption i never rly care for it until i go to college and every single person i meet kept on ask about my race like one of the first question most of the time again not an offensive question but for my situation it just hurt to even say the name of the country I be from I have be in america my whole life everything I have know be from america and my parent and now i let my parent down by flunk everything I be just such a sad lump of failure i still have fight in me i know i can do it i just need to tell them the truth but I be so scared i have not sleep for 40 hour bc of the thought about tell them I be so ashamed my friend even stop talk to me bc i slow them down which i honestly do not blame them for my first semester in college i save a kid life from suicide bc he want to jump off of a balcony i just grab him as hard as i could beg for him to not do it for 15 minute make sure he would not jump but he keep on want to die and it be like a tug of war battle to save him i get ptsd from that moment which just turn me into a turtle hiding inside their she will it start my existential crisis which be now a common part of my thinking process i think i should not influence who live or die I be not a divine be be it wrong to save him i do not want to be a factor for someone be own life its too fucking scary it be a nightmare i hate think so deeply about the world and meaning and life and be fuck shit at it I be just so sad but i have a little spark in me that still want to pursue and comeback its just all too much i just want to wake up one day and just not panic every think second tldr adopt kid have no personal or racial identity and be try to deal with the struggle of it first semester of college i save a person life from suicide and it give me ptsd and an existential crisis i continue college and fail the next 2 semester i have not tell my parent yet and i be petrify and ashamed,0

55,"my life story i guess; cystic fibrosis, heroin addiction, financial burden, health decline, and finally terrified",wap2005," ####**context:*** i was born with a terminal illness called cystic fibrosis and because doctors regularly tell you that you're going to die young, depression ends up being something that usually comes with the territory. i am currently 34 years old and the average life expectance of a cf patient as of today is 44years old, and due to many bad decisions i've made in my life (some highlighted below), i definitely won't be seeing that age.** in 2019 i was addicted to heroin, and because of the event below my girlfriend (of 11 years at the time) moved out into her own place, and the worst part is i understood why she needed to. i ended up overdosing in my garage and my 11 year old nephew found me on the floor. my girlfriends sister gave me narcan, but i didn't wake up till after the fire department came and gave me a 2nd dose. i was told my face was blue/purple. i owe her sister my life, and the amount of guilt i carry for the fact my nephew found me like that is insurmountable.* fast forward two years    ; we still don't live together but we are very much still in a relationship, probably in a better place than ever before, and it's because i now have 2 years and 4 months sober and we see a therapist on a regular basis. we are supposed to get a new place together in august/september of 2022 when her lease is up.####**things i am going through:*** i went in for my cystic fibrosis breathing test last friday, which i hadn't done in a long time. the test results that came back did not match the expectations that i had about my current state. my lung function is down to 33%. i haven't told anyone but my therapist so far because i don't know how to tell my family.* my girlfriends family is pretty much poor. she lives with her mother who retired early and took massive penalties on her 401k (even when we were telling her not to). her mother is now running out of money and is also an alcoholic. her sister (31yrs old) and nephew (13yrs old) also live there. i just found out that her sister has recently started paying rent with a credit card because she is not employed. my girlfriend is the only person who has a job in that house, and she just lost it and she is beating herself up so hard, and it is so hard to watch her do it. calling herself ""pathetic"", a ""no one"", or ""nothing"" and she says them as if they are facts, not opinions. even if it isn't a fact, that's still her experience. it breaks my heart.* come august/september of 2022 when we are supposed to find a place together, i have no idea what their family is going to do. they wouldn't be able to afford rent for anything, they would end up with no place to live and i wouldn't ever feel comfortable knowing it. sadly this comes at the cost of my dreams though, and i have very limited time on this earth to achieve/reach those dreams. cystic fibrosis patients regularly talk about how we constantly have to change/shift our dreams due to the limitations of cystic fibrosis, and i am tired of having to do it. i have already taken enough time away from myself.* i have an extreme amount of dental issues, to the point where i have gone from 135lbs to 112lbs in the past month and a half. eating is just the least enjoyable thing i could do these days, every bite hurts, and i have to have special toothpicks that i use after almost every bite, of anything, or it hurts more because it gets compacted.####**how it all relates:**one thing a lot of doctors have recommended is moving to an area with a salt water beach close by. it's shown that living in places like santa cruz and hawaii improve the health of cf patients substantially because the salt in the air helps break down the mucus in our lungs which in return causes less scarring to them. i have made the decision that moving is something i ***need*** to do at this point.it's really hard to uproot your life and move far away from your family, your job, and your doctors/specialists (i've been seeing them since i was 18). it's extremely terrifying as well. but this is what i believe i need in order to live a longer fuller life. however i don't know how to tell my girlfriend ""my lung function is shit and i wanna move super far, oh and your family will be homeless"". my plan is to offer to pay for a retirement community for her mother, and i wanted to offer a spare bedroom in a place that we get together to her sister, as long as she is employed, and our nephew. i don't know how to talk about these things with her though, she will feel so many shitty feelings, she'll take it on personally as a massive boulder and she is already kicking her own ass about losing her job. i plan to bring up some of this in our next therapy session, but it's just so much and i don't want to put more on her shoulders, i want to take things off.i have been blessed with some pretty great opportunities in my life which has allowed me to work at some of the largest tech and social media companies around. but i feel like so much of what i make is going to go into keeping her family afloat, instead of taking me and her to paris or something for us, fun things to do before it's too late, before i get stuck in a hospital bed. but at the same time i don't want to go to places like paris if she's just going to be stressed about her family, she wouldn't want to spend that amount of money on a vacation when she knows her family actually needs it to have a roof over their head.i love my girlfriend, and the only way i would ever leave her side is by bullet or by request from her.but all of this happening at once just feel like way too much; constant dental issues (and pain), weight loss, health decline, watching my girlfriend beat herself up and be in emotional turmoil, i can see the guilt she is feeling on her face when i offer to help financially, the stress of financial burden, i also have a job i am stressed about somewhere in all of this, and then hardest part - i have to look mortality right in the face and confront it, and it's terrifying.#_____________#####**if you got this far, thanks you so much for reading this.**i know it was kind of a rambling of thoughts and they're probably way out of order. i'm just going through a

with myself because of how i was starting to look, my hairline receding , teeth getting messed up, getting some deep forehead lines at only 22, add my glasses i felt like i was going through all the things a man isn't supposed to deal with until he hits his 30s.i've tried to tell myself it doesn't matter, its just looks and vanity but its severely effected my confidence, before i used to see myself doing well in a social setting, now i isolate myself from everyone because i always feel insecure when socializing.there's also just the fact that i've never found something i care about, nothing i'm particularly good at, and when i turn my mind to try and get good at something, for some reason my appearance comes into play. i guess in a way i like to imagine what i'd look like when i

fiction writing, yeah its interesting that the only thing i care about is something that literally involves running from reality and escaping into a fantasy world.anyway, i had this interest in the past and it didn't feel worth it, but recently i've come to a place of solemn acceptance of my circumstances because i no longer feel the burden of needing to have a future. i no longer imagine myself reaching an older age, being great at something and growing into something amazing. these days i see my future as maybe lasting two or three years giving me time to write a few books, the success of which doesn't matter too much, then i can just end it.i know, it sounds messed up, but the idea that i can end my life at any time, that it doesn't have to be today is what's kept me going for the past year. i'm alive because, why kill myself today when i can do it tomorrow. i know for sure if i had to choose between living out my life in full and ending it now i would choose now, but the idea that suicide is always an option is comforting to me. its always there for the day i no longer see a reason to push on.i know that's not what a lot of people want to hear, but its what's brought me to

269,i'm a worthy of being sad? [m17],fleetflot," i don't feel like i want to be happy. the numb feeling of life i've come to know feels more home than the ""feeling"" of home i think i felt some time in the past. people are always confused about my mental health. i seem to be friends with everyone. i got awarded friend of the year from my whole boarding school without hesitation from anyone. i was proud,  and i think for the last time happy. i can't for the life of me figure out when i startede feeling like this, or why, which just feels like another letdown from the one and only me.  i think people see something i don't, and i actually can see why they see what they see, but somehow i will never see it my self. to everyone els i am disgustingly succesful every time i do something, but i never seem to be able to see it that way. there is always that thing i didn't do, that sekund i didn't spend on that hobby, and it never ends, that long list of things i never did.  my big outlet is musik and fotografi. i feel i can capture my feelings and portray them in those select pictures that appear every so often. however when i try and show the world, the same thing happens. they see something beautiful. full of life and joy, when all i see is my sad soulless life, with a search for perps that maybe will be my only ever perps.  musik helps my fly into this world of vulnerability that i need to try and understand life. the effect that musik gives me is frustratingly a thing a can never seem to translate to people. it's always just a comment about the genre or the artist.  i don't feel worthy of this emptiness. my life is in no way comparable to any of the stuff i'm told should make me feel this empty. i come from an way above average household with to still married parents and a sister i'm more proud of than i will ever be of anything. in less than six months i will get a car that most families would be happy to have as their primary car. however non of the above seem to have any effect. i have tried cutting and planing in detail where and how to commit suiside, yet still it only made my felling of disepointment bigger. i've come to the point where i don't know what is keeping me from doing it, maybe the physical pain but even than it'll only take enough physiological pain to render that excuse useless. i don't think i'm suicidal, but if my heart were to stop, or my life be treated otherwise, i wouldn't want to be held alive in some hospital bed. i truly wish in that situation that  people would let me get my last wish, a painless fadeaway.  i hope this is the right place for

837,i want to post this to my social media on the date mentioned. any feedback? is it weird to do this?,Restful_Confusion," one year ago- december 20th, 2020 11:24 am. i was in a really dark place, for a lot of different reasons. that day someone saved my life and didn't even know it. so now, a year later, i want to share my story in hopes that i can help someone else. the first time i ever thought i was depressed, i was about 12. my normal outgoing self had been homeschooling for a year and a half with no end in sight. i wanted to get out and be with my friends again. fast forward 5 years, and my friends were drifting away. i was a junior in high school when i really started struggling mentally. it was right around then that i started harming myself- never anything major though.going into senior year i got closer to a male friend who turned out to be not very nice. he pushed me and my mental health declined. after graduation i didn't talk to him again, and i started getting better. in the late summer of 2020 i met someone, and we became fast friends. they became the first person i had ever told about my depression and self harm. eventually though, people did what they do and i was heartbroken. i knew they still cared in my heart but my brain told me that i was better off leaving everyone behind. i got pretty bad for a while.one year ago today, i said some things to them hoping i would hurt them back. the next morning they called my dad, who told my mom. from the moment she walked into my room i knew what had happened. after almost 4 months of secrecy,

it’s not the end of the world. but now since a similar pressure is on me, sometimes i get thoughts about ending it all. cause the pressure of thinking about the money being spent on me and me in turn disappointing my parents almost seems unbearable. but i am trying to make peace with it. peace with not getting a co-op job or failing a subject and wasting money. cause i want to believe my life is worth more than that? i don’t usually reach out for help. but i have been trying. i tried telling mom that i am not enjoying my degree and like this is tough and all but the only reply i get “it was your choice to go to canada” i get it. it was my choice. but i am not depressed because life is tough in canada. for me life is tough because i am depressed. that depression part won’t change if i am in canada or india. this sentence just isolates me further.  i feel like everyone around me is in a race and i am failing to catch up. always coming last. i feel like a little bit of me is always in the past and a little bit of me is always in the future. but never in the present. it feels like i am living in someone else’s story. i don’t feel like the main character of my own life. i feel like i am just a walking, living piece of disappointment. failed to live up to it’s full potential. i feel like a little bit of everything and all of nothing at the same time. like a warm soup without salt. i cannot “take time” to focus on my mental and physical health. i am privileged but not this privileged. cause everyone is forming careers getting jobs and i don’t want to start from zero when then have all already settled. but at the same time i don’t know what to do with a life that doesn’t even feel mine.",1.0,0.0,Depression,i want to get better but capitalism be ruin my life tw mention of suicide in the year 2021 i get diagnose with a lot of shiz adhd major clinical depression generalise and social anxiety and a pinch of ocd due to all this my brain sometimes do horrible thing on the outside i might appear to be sane but on the inside i feel like i be in a cage prisoner to my own mind i get these horrible horrible intrusive thought sometimes these be relate to suicidal ideation intrusive thought about suicide major depressive episode be not a good mix it make simple task like take a bath as hard as climb a mountain i be an international student in canada and my home country be india as a kid or teen whenever i hear about story relate to suicide where the person die because they be stress about school class or fail i always think failing be not a big deal its okay its just a subject so what if you fail its not the end of the world but now since a similar pressure be on me sometimes i get thought about end it all because the pressure of think about the money be spend on me and me in turn disappointing my parent almost seem unbearable but i be try to make peace with it peace with not get a coop job or fail a subject and waste money because i want to believe my life be worth more than that i do not usually reach out for help but i have be try i try tell mom that i be not enjoy my degree and like this be tough and all but the only reply i get it be your choice to go to canada i get it it be my choice but i be not depress because life be tough in canada for me life be tough because i be depress that depression part will not change if i be in canada or india this sentence just isolate me further i feel like everyone around me be in a race and i be fail to catch up always come last i feel like a little bit of me be always in the past and a little bit of me be always in the future but never in the present it feel like i be live in someone elses story i do not feel like the main character of my own life i feel like i be just a walk live piece of disappointment fail to live up to its full potential i feel like a little bit of everything and all of nothing at the same time like a warm soup without salt i can not take time to focus on my mental and physical health i be privilege but not this privilege because everyone be form career get job and i do not want to start from zero when then have all already settle but at the same time i do not know what to do with a life that do not even feel mine,0

828,it's getting worse (rant),Pole-Slut," (sorry for errors, i'm not native speaker)i don't want to live anymore, i can't go on feeling like this. years of psychological bullying have made me feel insecure, unsuitable, incapable and weak. they have always made me feel inadequate, derided and called with dehumanizing nicknames, at most they called me by surname. i was that weird, loser. bullied about my weight, my way of appearing, my appearance, about my sexuality and gender identity. i also had episodes of violence, punching, spitting. exploited because i was the one who did best in school. i was always terrified as soon as i walked through the school door. and being away from home in high school didn't help me. the first years i lived with experiences of extreme anxiety, abandonment, darkness, very traumatic. my self-esteem is zero, i feel judged, i'm afraid to relate to people for it. i always think i can be annoying and being criticized. being seen in the face gives me anxiety, sometimes i can't even look my family in the eye, i feel observed and judged while i eat, while i'm doing something, i panic. i can't talk on the phone, and i have so much anxiety from phone calls and messages that i have taken off all social networks. even in video games, which i liked a lot before, and i had an interest but now no longer because of the depression, i don't add anyone because after three days i would block people because they make me anxious just the thought of them seeing me online. yet people find me nice, and i have many friend requests, i would really like to have social relationships, but it is impossible for me ... i use an application that makes me appear invisible to my cousin, who i don't speak to for a year because of avoidant personality disorder. i haven't been out of the house for many years, only for necessary reasons. i moved away from the few friendships i made at school, they looked for me, but i avoided them by not responding to any message or call, i disappeared. i feel awful and guilty. i have no future, i have anxiety and terror that every time i think about it, i get panic attacks. i no longer find taste in anything, i don't feel pleasure. i have no passion, no ambitions, no desire to do anything. everything weighs on me. even personal hygiene. and i'm clinging to anorexia as the only purpose in my life that gives me a minimum of euphoria and control, i've lost 18 kg and still want to lose weight despite being underweight. and i don't fucking know what to do next.currently, i live locked in my room (i live with my parents) since years when the only thought is to lose weight, the only force that keeps me going is this. nothing else ... i can no longer put a smile on my face and pretend that everything is fine. i feel like shit and i want to die, i want everything to finish, i cannot live in this state anymore. i don't have the will and the reason to get help from a psychologist, i can't. having to face life is too much, a huge mountain that crushes me, made of pressures and expectations. it is not physical pain where i rest and take medicine and heal. they are years of pain and ailments derived

(sister's name) doesn't have it. she *wants* to have it."" of course, i shared that with said sister. i just need to be tested everything in the books, then put on medication to pause it all. maybe then i will succeed in my classes. all of these mental problems i have are putting my classwork on hold; i cannot focus, i cannot stop surfing the internet, i constantly put off the work. it all makes sense that there is something wrong. my mom always said i was *just like her*. i know why. she passed all of her mental problems onto me. she says, ""it's so odd how we act the same, like the same stuff, and have the same humor!"" she doesn't get it. she never will. she just wants to believe what she wants to hear. her daughter doesn't have any problems, she's a sweet angel who has a

438,my(25f) entire family hates me,Smallpiscesgurl," as the holidays are coming up my depression kicks in x100. i have been no contact for about a year(on and off sort of) with basically my entire family on my moms side(abusive) and my dads side.my dad and i have a complicated relationship. he didnt raise me but as a teenager i would move back and forth between him and my mom due to my mom seperating from my abusive step dad. alot of emotional strain on our relationship because i was a difficult teenager. my dad and his wife at the beginning helped me alot. but also were really abusive to me because i was more effort. i grew up with a bipolar mother so it was very one sided i didnt get to express my emotions so when i lived with my dad all i could do was cry whenever they would get mad at me. my step mom is very manipulative... she would get mad at me because i grew up very introverted and hiding in my room so if i didnt go up and ""greet"" my dad after he got off work i was being ""disrespectful"". but growing up if i did that to my mom she would get mad at me for bothering her after a long day.i was basically relearned alot of normal habits. but the way they went about it was wrong. my step mom gave me a cell phone when i moved provinces and whenever me and my dad had a falling out she would take my phone away, i was 19-20 at this point i understand parents parenting but she wasnt really in a place to do that. i was used to the games dealing with my mom. so the first time she did it i gave the phone back completely because i just didnt want to have those ties of her using it against me anytime she deemed i wasnt respecting my dad. my dad wasnt really my dad... he pushed alot for me to call him dad but it took years for me to get comfortable doing that. as i type this im crying because im realizing all he was doing was trying to help me. my step mom was very jealous of me and my dads bond we are basically the same person in terms of looks, hobbies, personality... she felt threatened so her controlling tendencies really over ruled our relationship.i was in a relationship so i would spend some nights at my boyfriend and his family and whenever i came home she would passive aggressively say ""well why dont you just move in with his family"". and thats just the beginning. i initially moved there for a visit but then they convinced me to sign up for business school which i got accepted and my step mom was gonna cosign my student loans. but lets take it back to when she gave me the phone.... the time i gave it back to her she got it unlocked went through all my texts with my step dad(who is also a terrible person). the conversations id have with my step dad would be me crying or hiding from my step mom and my step dad told me to get her to cosign my student loans and just move out. she put that against me.... thats the grudge she still holds to this day. i never even agreed or said i wanted to do that to her because she did go out of her way to help me. but she took what my step dad said and just ran with it.... she to this day doesnt want anything to do with me and it hurts. i always try to remember the positive experiences i had with her.... and i know it'll never be the same with her or my dad.this is a very brief short description of the details. my step dad was a huge influence he was a

434,today i had a chance to meet patients that received my donation... my heart melted.,lustigesKatzchen," former redditor here, had to share my experience with someone.i have a company that i founded two years ago, and we design sports clothing and sports shoes. it's not a large company but still, i have roughly 30 employees and produce around 1000-2000 units per month.anyway, a while ago i had a great stroke of luck; i was in a traffic accident while driving late at night. my girlfriend (now wife) was pregnant and luckily she decided not to come with me because she wasn't feeling well. during the drive, my car started sliding on the road which was frozen (it was mid december) and i drove off the road and struck a tree. one huge branch broke through the windshield and penetrated the seat next to me, where my gf would have been sitting if she decides to come with me.i was alright and somehow just got bruised elbow and fractured palm. when i came back home from the hospital i decided to do something to repay my karma (j am not religious that much) and decided to donate some amount to childrens hospital from my local town. because i was moved with their reply letter, i decided to help them every few months, sending as much as i can every time.however, as the time went by i slowly became distant from the whole donation thing and one day i thought to myself how i should stop donating because i don't even know to whom i'm giving.i talked to my wife (we became married at that moment) and she had a suggestion; i should go to that hospital and visit the kids, so i did......and it broke my heart. unknowingly, the main nurse found my picture on my social media and recognized me immediately. when i came, the nurse jumped and hugged me so hard that i could barely breathe. after a small chat, she decided to take me to children that were treated by my donations.my heart was melting at that point. they recognized me immediately, because apparently she did show some kids who is the man who is helping them and smiles on their faces were non stop! they invited me to play games with them, draw and even made me sing for them even tho i am horrible singer and would never usually do that. i spent almost my whole day with them and i didn't know if i should laugh with them or cry, because i had a doubt if i should continue helping them or not. how selfish of me... one girl made a doll for me and she said that she tried to create character with my looks but ""messed up the nose"" which made me laugh so much, mostly because my nose is kinda weirdthe day quickly flew by but i have decided and promised to them that i will visit them every time i can and at least once a week. those kids are angels. i increased my donation amount and am currently preparing a contract to purchase new equipment for the whole wing. i can barely afford it, i will have to take a lot from my savings but damn, they have deserved it.that's basically it... sorry for shortened up story and lack of information but i really don't want to dox myself.. i only have a suggestion for all of you chaps and girls, if you can help, do help!

248,unable to make others understand,sweetbow," hi, new here. i was diagnosed with depression and anxiety when i was 19/20 years old and have been on anti psychotics (for depression)/anti depressants since. i have a history of suicidal behaviour and attempts. in my early twenties, i’ve been in and out of the psych ward countless times and have had two major attempts on my life. for maybe a year i spent most of my time in bed, fantasizing about death and well, being depressed.i’ve since made strides to change my life. i left school, started a creative freelancing job, and moved out of my parents. i lived with my ex for nearly two years before moving to another city the beginning of this year on my own.i have struggled with bulimia and anorexia since i was 8 and have not gotten proper help to address it. i used to be very thin. it’s not entirely abnormal for my height and people just always thought as i got thinner, i was losing “baby” weight. i have since gained more than 50 lbs since the death of my grandmother and with the new move. given my anorexia from before, i wouldn’t consider myself overweight but maybe a little chubby for lack of better words. i am about 5’1 and a size 6/8 whereas i used to be a size 00. moving to a new city ended up being too much for me and i fell into a suicidal and depressive haze that really scared me. i decided it would be best for me to move back home with my parent. i wasnt working much before my move home and essentially my parents had to bail me out. i’m living with them now and feel awful. of course i intend to pay them back every cent but i still feel like such a burden and failure.my parents have made a lot of comments about my weight and have encouraged me to get back to my past size. they’ve even made comments about how much prettier i used to be. i feel traumatized by heavy exercise because the thought of it just brings me back to a dark place where i would work out 2-3 times a day and live off nothing but black coffee and cigarettes. i’m not inactive, i go on walks and occasionally hop on the bike.i just feel so much pressure from them to lose weight and they say it’ll help with my depression but i feel that they don’t understand what i’m going through.i’ve tried to explain it but ive been called lazy and that i’m making up excuses to not want to be healthier. i know i’m suicidal right now but have been doing a much better job of controlling it/faking being ok for the sake of my friends and family.i hurt a lot of people with my attempts before. i can’t help but feel like if i tried this time, i would

231,i think i want to kill myself. it’s too hard to imagine a good future for me,urmomscooking," i (19f) have always been terrified to end up how my mother did. she is such a creative person, who had hopes and dreams from a young age. she has drive, but had to settle. after a few years, she finally just gave up. now she lives an average life, maybe a bit below an average life. she has three bio children (including me) and is married to a good man. but her house. it’s horrible. it was disgusting all the time. she never liked cleaning or taking care of things. she doesn’t have a job now, and she seems to live the same day over an over. i’ve never known a life without my depression. despite this, i had drive and was constantly chasing my dreams. but lately it’s become too much to handle. i dropped out of school, even though i was supposed to finish in april. my partner and i are moving in together soon, but we will have to live with their mom until we can find a place. we both just got new jobs, so we are waiting for our paystubs to come in for proof of income before we can apply anywhere. for the last 5 months i’ve had a friend living with me to get out of her very bad household. i feel like she kind of ruined me. she’s moved out now, only because i have to get rid of my things and put them in storage. the couch won’t be in the living room anymore, which is where she would sleep. she made me feel like a rehab center. if you look at my last posts, they’ll explain in more detail. i haven’t been able to go to the doctors to get treatment because i won’t be able to get on insurance for a few months, and my medication was costing an arm and a leg. i couldn’t afford it. so now i’m off my meds for depression, but i also have a very severe case of hypothyroidism. the hypothyroidism is most definitely a factor in my depression, because my doctors treated me like a guinea pig and were constantly changing it with no reason to. i understand that your levels change, but the thing is is that they would change my medication when they wouldn’t even check my levels at all. it’s hard to not give out too many personal details to better explain. but essentially, i’m unable to take my medications at the moment on top of the only medication i can take is making it worse. but with the very little they give me is most certainly better than nothing. i tried talking to them about it but they blamed all the problems i was having on my other meds. told my psychiatrist what they said, and he told me what i was on had none of the affects they were claiming. i tried to schedule my next appointment only to discover they shut down. i know i’m young, but it feels like i am running out of time to make my life less than average. i am so scared of having a boring life. i have had the same dream for so long, but i decided i wanted to outside my other dream but it has been way too difficult to focus on my future career when i am already stressed about moving and telling my family about school. i am so scared i am going to disappoint them, because they expected me to do amazing things that i just don’t feel like i can do right now. i feel like the fear is so strong that i’m caving into myself. anyway, the reason i made this post is because i think i want to kill myself. i just have this horrible feeling i am never going to be better than average, and if i am unsuccessful i would rather kill myself now than live a few more years feeling like this. i think i just needed to vent. i’m sorry for the novel, and even if i don’t get any replies and you read this, thank you. just feeling like someone acknowledges this it makes me feel seen.",1.0,0.0,Depression,i think i want to kill myself its too hard to imagine a good future for me i 19f have always be

101,"i've just had a thought, and it's got my gears turning. hear me out.",Black_Leopard1904," many people ask ""why?"" questions, but not enough ""how?"" questions. why questions result in even more why questions even after getting an answer to the previous question, but if you asked a how question, there's a very high chance of getting the answers to all or most of the questions in the why chain. here's an example (now, i'm not an expert on trains, so bear with me):you're at a train station awaiting the arrival of the train that you'll be boarding. it arrives 25 minutes late. you, being the curious mind that you are, ask the conductor a question:you: why did you arrive late?conductor: a component was damaged and we stopped to repair it.you: why don't you run a last-minute check, like what they do at airports?conductor: not enough time.you: why don't you make time?see the trend? one answer leads to another question. the human mind isn't satisfied by one miniscule piece of information. it desire more in order to piece the puzzle together and understand the entire situation, the events leading up to it, etc. now, let's rewind and try this example out with a how question.you: how is the trains' logistics managed?conductor: well, the trains work in shifts so that the railway doesn't face anything similar to that of traffic on a highway. the first batch of trains begins work at 12 midnight. they are checked in case they're in need of any maintenance, then stocked with necessary equipment, allocated staff, and set to work. then at the same time the next day, the next batch is set to work while the first batch undergoes necessary maintenance. in case of any casualty, one of the resting trains will replace the damaged train.see that? it's difficult to ask a how question in a situation better suited for a why question, but if the how question is phrased the right way, it will save time and you'll get potentially more information from one question. think of it like reaping 50 wheat stalks with a machine instead of doing one at a time by hand.",6.0,16.0,CasualConversation,I have just have a thought and its get my gear turn hear me out many people ask why question but not enough how question why question result in even more why question even after get an answer to the previous question but if you ask a how question there be a very high chance of get the answer to all or most of the question in the why chain here be an example now I be not an expert on train so bear with meyoure at a train station await the arrival of the train that you will be board it arrive 25 minute late you be the curious mind that you be ask the conductor a questionyou why do you arrive lateconductor a component be damage and we stop to repair ityou why do not you run a lastminute check like what they do at airportsconductor not enough timeyou why do not you make timesee the trend one answer lead to another question the human mind be not satisfy by one miniscule piece of information it desire more in order to piece the puzzle together and understand the entire situation the event lead up to it etc now let us rewind and try this example out with a how questionyou how be the train logistics managedconductor well the train work in shift so that the railway do not face anything similar to that of traffic on a highway the first batch of train begin work at 12 midnight they be check in case they be in need of any maintenance then stock with necessary equipment allocate staff and set to work then at the same time the next day the next batch be set to work while the first batch undergoes necessary maintenance in case of any casualty one of the resting train will replace the damage trainsee that its difficult to ask a how question in a situation well suit for a why question but if the how question be phrase the right way it will save time and you will get potentially more information from one question think of it like reap 50 wheat stalk with a machine instead of do one at a time by hand,1

think that bad day for my mother to receive a call from the police and to be told that her son is dead, i mean, he ruined the party, well, but what now causes me conflict is that my mother told me that she saw me as coibido hahaha. i am introverted and half shy, but that comment made me feel unwell, i just feel tired of living i don't feel good every night i can't sleep well and that fucking

393,i dont like anything about myself.,gwm519," **tw: ed, sh, addiction, sex, mental illness**why is it that when i accomplish something i end up feeling like shit afterwards? i usually dont rant online but i express my feelings without doing something destructive. i've been in recovery for substance abuse for over 9 months now and while my sobriety has enabled me to accomplish so much, i still cant help but feel like its negatively affected my mental health. when im sober, i fall into a rabbit hole of overthinking and overanalyzing every part of my life. i hate feeling so aware and i just want to use again. of course, i have healthy outlets that get me out of my head but its only so effective.i just finished my last application to college, and while i should feel proud; its a huge accomplishment, i cant help but feel like shit about it. i couldn't even tell you why i feel this way, i did everything right and i have a good chance of getting into a lot of the schools i applied too. this is just one example, i am incapable of allowing myself to be proud of my accomplishments. i always need to analyze and do better. possibly that stems from my parents unhealthy expectations of me, and now when i am living up to their expectations, its now caused me to set these ridiculously high goals that to any ""normal"" person would be laughable. i dont even know what my expectations are anymore, i want to go to medical school but i dont think thats unrealistic.more damaging, is the expectation that i have set for my body. ever since my sobriety, i had the mental capacity to see myself for more than just an addict. i was able to use some of my time to focus on my appearance. i've always struggled with body image but it was not until recently that i could prioritize it, no matter how unhealthy it would become. i either dont eat the entire day, and then im starving and cant fall asleep because im so hungry, or i eat a lot and then throw it up. i bought a scale (dumbest decision ever) and since i bought it i watch the numbers fluctuate a few digits multiple times a day. why is it that a number can hold so much power in my perception of self? if im 137.2 or 139.4 it makes no difference, but i convince myself that its everything. i hate it. i hate it. i hate it. i'm begging for help, but at the same time i dont want to change. my eating disorder becomes so comforting. i have control over something, when historically, my addiction took charge of my decision making.i live with my dad full time, and he's so clueless. how can this man not notice me vomiting in the bathroom and then crying until i cant cry anymore? i mean, i do block him out of my life, of course he wouldn't notice; he still thinks i'm straight.i hate that i crave attention from older men. have i really reduced myself to that? i would spend hours on grindr looking for someone to fuck me, then i would never talk to them again. i would go to their house, we would have sex, then i would go home, cry, throw up, cry some more, and repeat the cycle. its like im almost asking for it. it took long time, but i have deleted the app, not because i dont want to have sex with older men, but because i'm too mentally unstable to have sex period. i'll do it again, i know myself. i'm old enough to know these decisions have real consequences. but was i partially at fault when i was raped by someone twice my age? i mean, after all i did go to his house with the intention of having sex. god, that was awful, being held down, not knowing if i was going to get out of there. i put myself in these situations and i dont learn from them.i really just want to be happy, im tired of putting on a facade. im tired of spending so much time in the morning trying to look good, when inside im so broken. people dont see the bags under my eyes, how can they not see them? i dont sleep, and when i do i cant wake up. i just want to say, and genuinely mean it too that ""i'm okay."" sorry if that was a lot, no one has to read this either, but i just needed to get my feelings out. thanks :)",3.0,0.0,Depression,i do not like anything about myself tw ed sh addiction sex mental illnesswhy be it that when i accomplish something i end up feel like shit afterwards i usually do not rant online but i express my feeling without do something destructive I have be in recovery for substance abuse for over 9 month now and while my sobriety have enable me to accomplish so much i still can not help but feel like its negatively affect my mental health when I be sober i fall into a rabbit hole of overthinking and overanalyzing every part of my life i hate feel so aware and i just want to use again of course i have healthy outlet that get me out of my head but its only so effectivei just finish my last application to college and while i should feel proud its a huge accomplishment i can not help but feel like shit about it i could not even tell you why i feel this way i do everything right and i have a good chance of get into a lot of the school i apply too this be just one example i be incapable of allow myself to be proud of my accomplishment i always need to analyze and do better possibly that stem from my parent unhealthy expectation of me and now when i be live up to their expectation its now cause me to set these ridiculously high goal that to any normal person would be laughable i do not even know what my expectation be anymore i want to go to medical school but i do not think that be unrealisticmore damaging be the expectation that i have set for my body ever since my sobriety i have the mental capacity to see myself for more than just an addict i be able to use some of my time to focus on my appearance I have always struggle with body image but it be not until recently that i could prioritize it no matter how unhealthy it would become i either do not eat the entire day and then I be starve and can not fall asleep because I be so hungry or i eat a lot and then throw it up i buy a scale dumbest decision ever and since i buy it i watch the number fluctuate a few digit multiple time a day why be it that a number can hold so much power in my perception of self if I be 1372 or 1394 it make no difference but i convince myself that its everything i hate it i hate it i hate it I be beg for help but at the same time i do not want to change my eat disorder becomes so comfort i have control over something when historically my addiction take charge of my decision makingi live with my dad full time and he so clueless how can this man not notice me vomit in the bathroom and then cry until i can not cry anymore i mean i do block him out of my life of course he would not notice he still think I be straighti hate that i crave attention from older men have i really reduce myself to that i would spend hour on grindr look for someone to fuck me then i would never talk to them again i would go to their house we would have sex then i would go home cry throw up cry some more and repeat the cycle its like I be almost ask for it it take long time but i have delete the app not because i do not want to have sex with older men but because I be too mentally unstable to have sex period ill do it again i know myself I be old enough to know these decision have real consequence but be i partially at fault when i be rap by someone twice my age i mean after all i do go to his house with the intention of have sex god that be awful be hold down not know if i be go to get out of there i put myself in these situation and i do not learn from themi really just want to be happy I be tire of put on a facade I be tire of spending so much time in the morning try to look good when inside I be so broken people do not see the bag under my eye how can they not see them i do not sleep and when i do i can not wake up i just want to say and genuinely mean it too that I be okay sorry if that be a lot no one have to read this either but i just need to get my feeling out thanks,0

622,a grim prediction of the metaverse (vr) future,WaltzIll1534," i imagine that the evolution of vr (virtual reality) and it's by-products like meta, inc. may lead to a future where our lives are lived in vr as much as they are in rl (real life). in every home, there is a special ""vr room"" where there exists equipment to connect one to the vr world, per each member of the household. a sort of equipment that suspends you in the air while at the same time provides you full mobility, like you would be able to move in rl. in this state of supension, your mobility is so good, you can be able to perform actions such as crawling, squatting, running, full body exercise incl. lifting weights, somersaults, etc. think of it like being suspended in the air using magnetic force. you've seen the desk lamp that suspends the bulb in air using magnets, right? **or** a *~~ball~~* of ""material"" that, while engulfed into it's epicenter, internally shifts into the form that matches your body movement. in case you're wondering about vision, meta, inc. is apparently developing the next generation of vr headsets that are expected to be so good, your eyes may not be able to differentiate between a well simulated vr and reality. this is technology that could be released as soon as 2022, folks! we ain't even that far from this future... damn.as for feeling things, maybe the equipment is fitted with a device that produces a magnetic force that can be extremely well manipulated to feel like the objects that exist in the vr world. for example, if you reach out to grab a waist-high wall so you can jump over it, the equipment would produce a +vely charged magnetic force in-front of you in the shape of a waist-high wall that repels your -vely charged body suit (palm of your hands and fingers) which would trick you into feeling it's presence (texture and solidity).in this future, you wake up, have breakfast, take a shower, put on a special body suit, then go to the vr room to join the rest of your family (who woke up early and had a head start) in the vr world. this includes old people who, in case of body deterioration and assuming the *~~ball~~* of ""material"" is how the future unravels, the *~~ball~~* would be able to provide body support and even help them perform the intended body movement. every time someone connects to the vr world, everyone connected to the family hub would be able to see them and maybe you could hold a 2-mins short family meeting once everyone is up and connected, before starting the day.okay, this is getting a bit scary especially since i'm typing this while high... holly shit... !! any other ideas what this ""vr future"" might look like?",3.0,20.0,CasualConversation,a grim prediction of the metaverse vr future i imagine that the evolution of vr virtual reality and its byproduct like meta inc may lead to a future where our life be live in vr as much as they be in rl real life in every home there be a special vr room where there exist equipment to connect one to the vr world per each member of the household a sort of equipment that suspend you in the air while at the same time provide you full mobility like you would be able to move in rl in this state of supension your mobility be so good you can be able to perform action such as crawl squat run full body exercise incl lift weight somersault etc think of it like be suspend in the air use magnetic force you have see the desk lamp that suspend the bulb in air use magnet right or a ball of material that while engulf into its epicenter internally shift into the form that match your body movement in case you be wonder about vision meta inc be apparently develop the next generation of vr headset that be expect to be so good your eye may not be able to differentiate between a well simulate vr and reality this be technology that could be release as soon as 2022 folks we be not even that far from this future damnas for feel thing maybe the equipment be fit with a device that produce a magnetic force that can be extremely well manipulate to feel like the object that exist in the vr world for example if you reach out to grab a waisthigh wall so you can jump over it the equipment would produce a vely charge magnetic force infront of you in the shape of a waisthigh wall that repel your vely charge body suit palm of your hand and finger which would trick you into feel its presence texture and solidityin this future you wake up have breakfast take a shower put on a special body suit then go to the vr room to join the rest of your family who wake up early and have a head start in the vr world this include old people who in case of body deterioration and assume the ball of material be how the future unravel the ball would be able to provide body support and even help them perform the intend body movement every time someone connects to the vr world everyone connect to the family hub would be able to see them and maybe you could hold a 2mins short family meeting once everyone be up and connect before start the dayokay this be get a bit scary especially since I be type this while high holly shit any other idea what this vr future might look like,1

52,darkest days of my life so far,Former-Yellow1201," hi, guys. i just want to share to you my experience.i've been in love with a girl for the last 8 years and i was planning to propose to her next year. i already talked to her parents and ask for their permission to court and marry her. we agreed that right after i finish my masters in graduate school, their daughter and i can do anything at that point. we were in love for a time (the last 4 years or so) and i was about to finish my masters next year (hence the proposal timing) but here's what happened.she decided to be apart from me last april because she stated that she was getting suffocated in our relationship. i want to support her and if space was what she needed to maintain her happiness, i willingly gave it to her. we decided that i will pursue her once again after i finish my academics. however, i just talked to her last night, and it was the worst night of my life.i told her all my plans next year and i already had everything prepared for our future. moreover, i gave her the assurance that my love for her never dwindled down even when we were apart, but fell in love more to her everyday even with the pain of separation during that time. i expected her to be happy and excited because finally, after loooong years of waiting, our time to be happy has finally come. but yep, your boy lost the war.she said that she fell in love with another guy during the time that we were apart, and the worst part is, i considered that guy as one of my friends. i can't imagine how she managed to fall for another in a very short amount of time. it is as if the years we spent together did not matter to her one bit. i prepared for 8 long years to be her husband but alas, in a short amount of time everything crumbled down. these are the feelings i genuinely felt right after i heard those words from her.but you see, i forgive her. i forgive the guy. i chose to be supportive of them because if that guy is the best man that can make the love of my life the happiest girl in the world, i'd gladly sacrifice my happiness for them. i did not argue with her the last night i talked to her, but reassured her instead that i will give it my all to move on from her as soon as i can so she can have a peace of mind and free her from the guilt of breaking me/ruining my life. i know that feeling angry at her/them is easier, but i really want to choose the harder path of forgiveness. i just couldn't manage to feel angry at them knowing i was partly to blame as well because of my negligence.i decided that i will take my time to heal and find a new circle of friends. the longer i am around her choosing to support her, the more i am bound to hurt myself. i decided and really want to move on with my life with my sanity intact and for that to happen, i have to stay as far away as possible from her. i do not want to think that one day that she will be back because that can mess with my life even more. i honestly do not know how long it will take for me to move on but i will do everything in my power to get out from this state. so that's it, the story of your boy. i learned a lot of invaluable lessons through these years and i am so willing to share it to anyone interested (or anyone who went through the same experience). i will post all my learnings on replies when i have the time this day, but for now, i got to talk to all the people involved and explain to them why we did not work out.to anyone who wants to vent out on this post's replies, please feel free. i'll reply as soon as i can. thanks for

40,idk how to feel,Some-Line2984," recently ive just felt like im in limbo. i know im not really depressed, but im not a happy person at the same time, but im also not really sad either. its very weird for me because earlier this year i really  hated myself, i hated being alive and i didnt really see any hope for myself lasting the rest of the year. i dont really have that mindset anymore , but at the same time i just dont feel like i have a positive future ahead. this year was very rough and honestly, it didnt have much positives, at all if any. i didnt really make any new friends, i didnt do anything special or accomplish anything with myself, and there wasnt any time during this year where i really felt happy, like i belonged anywhere. no one really checks up on me at all, i dont have any irls, no new relationships, my confidence levels are at low, nothing positive really. matter of fact ive lost more friends than i have gained over the past year. the most i can say that ive gained this year is really just a new job honestly. i do like it, but a new job can honestly mean just more stress in a way rather than an escape. i just feel confused really. like when is my time gonna come to be happy? recently ive just kind of accepted that i am lonely and have tried to embrace it, but i always ask myself if this is gonna be the life im destined to live? am i never gonna get to be happy? am i just not destined to get married, have kids, start a family of my own? will there really be no one else around me in my life other than my family? its just hard to accept really, but when i try to change it and turn things around, i never get any good results, and i just end up back at square one, with myself and only myself. around half of this year ive just kinda been by myself. like i said before, no one checks up on me, i go days, weeks, even months without even talking to another person thats not my family, or coworker. if i ever did talk to someone, i had to be the one who starts conversation. i have to be the one who invites myself or sets up anything. if i dont, i basically get no contact outside of my own house. its like no one values me as a friend, or even cares if im okay or not. and im gonna be honest, im getting really tired of being told, ""i wanted to reach out but i assumed you wanted space"". it pisses me off. if you wanted to know if i was okay, or at the least ask how i was doing, you wouldve messaged me. you wouldve made the effort to ask if i was okay if you really think of me as a friend, and not just hope that im recovering on my own. to me that phrase just says, ""im to lazy to reach out, hopefully youre okay"". its bullshit in my opinion. its just so sad to me that i have taken a lot of time towards the end of the year to just basically accept that im not supposed to talk to anyone, and thats just the life i'm meant to have. im already shy and introverted as it is. then you got all of this stuff on the side that doesnt help my social life, all the ptsd inducing experiences that ive encountered the last couple of years. people really are scary and evil creatures.  so yea, idk what else to say or think about my state of mind. i dont wanna die or even hate myself because i know my value as a person, im just not happy with how things have been and im not very hopeful for the future. just wish my time for happiness would come already. everyone says it will, and that i need to be patient. just dont know what i did to deserve this treatment. :(",1.0,0.0,Depression,idk how to feel recently I have just felt like I

528,"if it doesn’t get any better, i’m doing it on new year’s",HoboWithADildo," the year started out fine enough, i guess. at least financially. i found $280 at the casino in vegas and was also making thousands off cryptocurrency and stock market trades. i even saw $75,000 in my account at one point in june, the most money i’ve ever had. i even cashed out most of it at the peak, which was smart. but after financing a car i shouldn’t have bought because everything was gouged to the moon in june and 3 very expensive flat tires my “platinum warranty” didn’t help with and several months of bad trades, and daily life expenses, i’m back to less than $1000 to my name. got my rent paid off for the month and after that - nothing. guess i’ll just illegally sleep in the car that is keeping me trapped and drowning because selling it would likely involve a massive loss. i also owe a ton of taxes i don’t know how i’ll manage to scrape up. basically, my life is completely fucked and i’m a few weeks or months away from losing everything i cried, stressed and screamed so much for. 2 years of non stop stress for nothing. i hate how i have to live like this but this is the only thing that’s ever been close to working out for me. the dead end job path doesn’t work for me because the jobs i qualify for don’t even pay enough for basic housing and i’m tired of busting my ass for a company that thinks i don’t even deserve a roof over my head at night. i can’t possibly imagine anything getting better from here. i’ve been single my entire life. i don’t have any close friends and constantly have to move because i have no sense of stability. i hate how this country is so goddamn expensive that you practically have to be married to be able to afford it, and i’m unlovable so it’s not going to happen. so my plan is, if nothing improves by new year’s eve, i’m driving this fucking car off a cliff so no one can have it. it’s robbed me of everything and left me trapped. i hate how i need a car to do anything in this damn country but they’re such a money suck that owning one means you’ll always be drowning financially, no matter what type of car you buy. i’ve owned like 10 cars now, no matter what, they always keep me from getting ahead. im so sick of feeling like a rat on a wheel while these billionaire hedge fund assholes get to sleep at night knowing they’ll never worry about homelessness because they get to manipulate the market in their favor and nothing will be done about it. every level of our system feels so corrupt that i’m at the point i’d rather die than keep playing their game. i can’t win, no matter what i try, so fuck it, i quit. i did my best to be a good, caring and kind person and the world took full advantage of me. i get robbed and scammed on every fucking level. i’m sick of it. the world can find someone else to bully and reject and rip off and steal from and throw out in the cold. i’m done being their punching bag. the thought of another year on earth with these pieces of shit makes me sick to my stomach. i won’t do it. i refuse. life just isn’t for me. i seem to fail at everything i do and attempt and i have no will left to keep going, even if it does make my parents sad. i can’t keep suffering for the sake of the people who brought me here in the first place. either some ridiculous stock market miracle saves me or i’m blowing

986,i’m starting to feel like a bad friend for not texting my mates first.,jemappellelara," hi all,so i’m into my first two months of first year at university, and i made a wide range of friends from everywhere (flatmates, coursemates, others in my accommodation, people that go to my uni). naturally, i started to become closer with certain people more than others (based on how often i see them). the weird thing is, i don’t text people i’m closest with every day because i always feel as though i’m bothering them if i were to even say a simple “hello, you alright?”, yet when we are face to face, i could have a smooth, consistent, flowing conversation without it being a silent or awkward moment. i don’t know what’s wrong with me, maybe i just don’t like texting? the only thing is, when i text said people, it’s only when i feel like texting them, if i “need”/“want” something from them, or there’s something urgent. i didn’t see this as a big deal at first, but now i realise maybe this is what is preventing me from having close. one time, i went out for coffee with a girl in my course and then i now barely talk to her unless it’s to see if she’s going out tonight. another thing holding me back from texting is the fact that people don’t text me first anyways. therefore, i don’t feel that they too are interested in me as much as i am them, probably because they see i don’t text them so they don’t bother.i’m not an introvert by any means; i like to talk to people, enjoy myself with good company, and like to hang out and always down for a night out. however, this problem i have is so bad to the point where i haven’t even talked to most people from back home yet. i feel like a shit from for only texting when i feel i need to text instead of reaching out to people myself.is it normal to have a closer connection with someone when you see them in person than by text or social media? or is it a dick move to only talk to people when you see them but not any further? should i make the effort to reach out to people more? would this make people be more willing to text me? any and all advise is needed and welcomed!",7.0,3.0,CasualConversation,I be start to feel like a bad friend for not texting my mate first hi allso I be into my first two month of first year at university and i make a wide range of friend from everywhere flatmate coursemates others in my accommodation people that go to my uni naturally i start to become closer with certain people more than others base on how often i see them the weird thing be i do not text people I be closest with every day because i always feel as though I be bother them if i be to even say a simple hello you alright yet when we be face to face i could have a smooth consistent flow conversation without it be a silent or awkward moment i do not know what be wrong with me maybe i just do not like texting the only thing be when i text say people its only when i feel like texting them if i needwant something from them or there be something urgent i do not see this as a big deal at first but now i realise maybe this be what be prevent me from have close one time i go out for coffee with a girl in my course and then i now barely talk to her unless its to see if she be go out tonight another thing hold me back from texting be the fact that people do not text me first anyways therefore i do not feel that they too be interested in me as much as i be them probably because they see i do not text them so they do not botherim not an introvert by any mean i like to talk to people enjoy myself with good company and like to hang out and always down for a night out however this problem i have be so bad to the point where i have not even talk to most people from back home yet i feel like a shit from for only texting when i feel i need to text instead of reach out to people myselfis it normal to have a closer connection with someone when you see them in person than by text or social medium or be it a dick move to only talk to people when you see them but not any further should i make the effort to reach out to people more would this make people be more willing to text me any and all advise be need and welcome,1

784,am i creepy?,BorderBrush," i'm  really questioning my sanity lately. i am 24 years old, female in a   relationship and currently studying computer science. first off i have   to mention that i don't have many friends. if i feel comfortable with   someone i can be very social, but i can also be very controlled in fear   of making a mistake or coming across to clingy or needy. i have had bad   experiences with friendships in the past. with females i am very  careful  and don't get too close, i am very helpful though. with males i  am very  open and become a bit like their mother if i start to like  them (in a  platonic way). i feel i have a strong need to talk to  someone, to ""make  myself heard"".. i guess you have already noticed that  if you're still  reading this.now to the ""creepy"" part:i  have this situation at school  with a person i barely/ do not know. in  some of our lessons my class is  in a special room with computers. i was  once bored and left a note on my  table as a joke saying ""whoever reads  this: i really like your monitor  height settings"". the next time i was  in that room i got a reply saying  something like ""you made my day!!"". i  felt this was exciting and fun so i  continued with a meme i drew for  them. they liked that one too and said  ""this is brilliant. i have to  hang this up in my room."" because i didnt  want the contact to break  off, i decided to write another message. i  went into ""stalking mode""  and looked up some logged in users on the pc i  was sitting at. i saw  pieces of their name, so i asked them if their  name began with the  letter i guessed. i didn't get a reply. so some days  passed and i  decided to trigger them and wrote ""no answer is also an  answer."" it  came to happen that our class had an exam and we were early  for the  next lesson. so we were waiting in front of that certain room,  waiting  for the other class to finish their lesson. i realised it would  be a  bit awkward if i came in and saw who actually was my secret  ""penpal"".  so i decided to wait outside until everyone left the room. i  mean not  knowing made it the most fun you know? when i went in i saw a  message! i  was happy about it because that was kinda the highlight of my  day. i  read the message and laughed because it was written in a funny  way. a  few minutes later was in the middle of a conversation with my  classmate  when i saw a guy coming in to the room to my right side who  didn't  belong to our class. i decided to ignore him but suddenly felt  him  sneaking up to my desk to my left side. he was like ""oh excuse me , i   left my usb stick here"", pulled it out and left. i froze, i was so   stunned and felt a bit exposed. i wondered if it was just a coincidence    or if he did that on purpose to find out who i was or if he got sent  by  the actual penpal to check me out. the next day i had to repeat an  exam  i missed when i was sick. the teacher squeezed me in with another  class  who was also having an exam. of course it happened to be the same  class  my ""penpal"" was in. i was one of the first people in the room  and felt  like the biggest stalker ever. i mean how creepy is that,  first i get  exposed and now i even follow him?! i couldn't help but  think that way. i  was questioning myself , why i was doing this  (sending messages to a  stranger and somehow feeling connected to them).  my answer is: because  it felt good to do something unexpected,  surprising. i am just really  wondering if this behaviour is normal, how  others would judge this  situation and if i you think i am actually  creepy.thanks for reading.",3.0,8.0,CasualConversation,be i creepy I be really question my sanity lately i be 24 year old female in a relationship and currently study computer science first off i have to mention that i do not have many friend if i feel comfortable with someone i can be very social but i can also be very control in fear of make a mistake or come across to clingy or needy i have have bad experience with friendship in the past with female i be very careful and do not get too close i be very helpful though with male i be very open and become a bit like their mother if i start to like them in a platonic way i feel i have a strong need to talk to someone to make myself hear i guess you have already notice that if you be still read thisnow to the creepy parti have this situation at school with a person i barely do not know in some of our lesson my class be in a special room with computer i be once bore and leave a note on my table as a joke say whoever read this i really like your monitor height setting the next time i be in that room i get a reply say something like you make my day i felt this be excite and fun so i continue with a meme i draw for them they like that one too and say this be brilliant i have to hang this up in my room because i do not want the contact to break off i decide to write another message i go into stalk mode and look up some log in user on the pc i be sit at i saw piece of their name so i ask them if their name begin with the letter i guess i do not get a reply so some day pass and i decide to trigger them and write no answer be also an answer it come to happen that our class have an exam and we be early for the next lesson so we be wait in front of that certain room wait for the other class to finish their lesson i realise it would be a bit awkward if i come in and saw who actually be my secret penpal so i decide to wait outside until everyone leave the room i mean not know make it the most fun you know when i go in i saw a message i be happy about it because that be kind of the highlight of my day i read the message and laugh because it be write in a funny way a few minute later be in the middle of a conversation with my classmate when i saw a guy come in to the room to my right side who do not belong to our class i decide to ignore him but suddenly felt him sneak up to my desk to my left side he be like oh excuse me i leave my usb stick here pull it out and leave i freeze i be so stunned and felt a bit exposed i wonder if it be just a coincidence or if he do that on purpose to find out who i be or if he get send by the actual penpal to check me out the next day i have to repeat an exam i miss when i be sick the teacher squeeze me in with another class who be also have an exam of course it happen to be the same class my penpal be in i be one of the first people in the room and felt like the biggest stalker ever i mean how creepy be that first i get expose and now i even follow him i could not help but think that way i be question myself why i be do this send message to a stranger and somehow feeling connect to them my answer be because it felt good to do something unexpected surprising i be just really wonder if this behaviour be normal how others would judge this situation and if i you think i be actually creepythanks for read,1

325,stressed and depressed plz help😂,Suspicious-Ad4033," i'm honestly genuine when i say i have tried so hard to get my shit together and i just can't, so i'm reaching to reddit🤷🏼‍♀️not sure if i'll be able to explain correctly (you know how the human mind is) so bare with meto put it in simple terms, i feel like my life is shit and because of that...i feel like complete shit. yes, the basic teeenage depression is what i'm taking about! let's get started:my parents suddenly started degrading me and criticizing my every move so i feel they don't care about me. not only that but they never have spent time with me in my life, and seem to only care when it affects themselves. not gonna lie, i'm convinced this is because of my older brother who may have took their leniency too far, many many times...kinda started me off on a low-confidence lifestyle :/struggled to make friends as a kid, of course, and almost all of the friends i have made...left. now i'm not talking about some random friends that i only knew for a month...i could count about 8 people who i was close with for at least 2 years, that decided to stop talking to me. i have always been a very anxious person when it comes to how others think of me, so i have always tried to be a people pleaser. these people never had a big fight with me, drama behind the scenes, or anything. most just left. that's what's brain fucking me!the friends i do have, have been around for years and never have left. but, they became distant. none and i mean none of them text or call me anymore, and i have no idea why. nothing has changed, and i've never fought with them. it just breaks my heart.(side note: i spent a few months working on myself late 2019 and became happy, before covid hit...and that's a whole other story, but after losing myself again, it definetly made me start giving up)soobviously i can't put my entire depression into one little post, but that's the gist of it. i'm very anxious of how others feel about me, and i do everything i can to keep friends around and avoid fights. but somehow, even with no complications, things got fucked up. overall it makes me hate myself. what did i do to make them leave?why doesn't anyone like to talk to me?if i show that i'm scared, will they leave?will everyone just leave at some point like the others?all these questions that just lead to my only answer of ""i'm just a piece of shit...that's why"", no matter what i tell myself.this ruins everything.because: - if i want to make my parents treat me nicer, i need to accomplish things and be independent.- if i want to feel like people will like me, i need to go out more and talk to others- if i want my friends to talk to me, i need to be confident and happy so they enjoy my company.- etc.and i can't do any of that when i constantly hate myself and convince myself that there's no reason to try when nothing makes me happy anymore. not even vacations or drugs...so, my question is how do i help myself? i know there are so many people who struggle with the same things i do, and those who have overcome it. so i just need some kind of guidance. i feel small, dumb, annoying, quiet, lazy, boring, bland, and everything else.i hate myself.i just want to feel good about myself again and my life, but i can't find a reason to.",1.0,0.0,Depression,stress and depress plz help I be honestly genuine when i say i have try so hard to get my shit together and i just can not so I be reach to redditnot sure if ill be able to explain correctly you know how the human mind be so bare with meto put it in simple term i feel like my life be shit and because of thati feel like complete shit yes the basic teeenage depression be what I be take about let us get startedmy parent suddenly start degrade me and criticize my every move so i feel they do not care about me not only that but they never have spend time with me in my life and seem to only care when it affect themselves not go to lie I be convince this be because of my older brother who may have take their leniency too far many many timeskinda start me off on a lowconfidence lifestyle struggle to make friend as a kid of course and almost all of the friend i have madeleft now I be not talk about some random friend that i only know for a monthi could count about 8 people who i be close with for at least 2 year that decide to stop talk to me i have always be a very anxious person when it come to how others think of me so i have always try to be a people pleaser these people never have a big fight with me drama behind the scene or anything most just leave that be what be brain fuck methe friend i do have have be around for year and never have leave but they become distant none and i mean none of them text or call me anymore and i have no idea why nothing have change and I have never fight with them it just break my heartside note i spend a few month work on myself late 2019 and become happy before covid hitand that be a whole other story but after lose myself again it definetly make me start give upsoobviously i can not put my entire depression into one little post but that be the gist of it I be very anxious of how others feel about me and i do everything i can to keep friend around and avoid fight but somehow even with no complication thing get fuck up overall it make me hate myself what do i do to make them leavewhy do not anyone like to talk to meif i show that I be scar will they leavewill everyone just leave at some point like the othersall these question that just lead to my only answer of I be just a piece of shitthats why no matter what i tell myselfthis ruin everythingbecause if i want to make my parent treat me nicer i need to accomplish thing and be independent if i want to feel like people will like me i need to go out more and talk to others if i want my friend to talk to me i need to be confident and happy so they enjoy my company etcand i can not do any of that when i constantly hate myself and convince myself that there be no reason to try when nothing make me happy anymore not even vacation or drugsso my question be how do i help myself i know there be so many people who struggle with the same thing i do and those who have overcome it so i just need some kind of guidance i feel small dumb annoy quiet lazy boring bland and everything elsei hate myselfi just want to feel good about myself again and my life but i can not find a reason to,0

967,"i've been reminiscing about my time as a ski instructor with it starting to snow, and i thought i would share my absolute favourite story from that time a few years back.",Mr8sen,"  so i am a ski instructor. while i was training for my level 1 certification, i had this instructor. a semi-young scottish guy who was an absolute joy to work with. always joking around, and genuinely an awesome person. but, during the time we had him as our instructor, a rivalry started between me and him. he had this thing he called the first rule of a ski instructor. if you leave you poles unattended, he will knock them down. if you stick your poles in the snow to adjust your boots, bang, they are now laying down. just standing around and talking and you don’t want to hold your poles, smack, they are now 5 feet away. like he wouldn’t just push them down, he would full on smash them if he had the chance.during our training, after having had this happen twice to me during the same training session, i knew i was going to be a pain in his ass. from then on, if we were standing in line on the slope listening to him teaching, could i reach them and if he left them with out his hands on them, i would knock them down. and he couldn’t even be mad because he was doing the same thing, so he usually just took the defeat with a tired sigh.either way, i finished my training, got my certificate, and started teaching. but i didn’t stop. if i saw his skis and poles outside while he was inside the ski school, he would find that they were now on the ground when he came back. he would always mention it every time he saw me next. call me a “cheeky f\*\*\*er”, and you could just see on his face that he knew that he himself caused this. i had a great time with it. he could be with clients, and i would just walk over and whack them down, and just continue walking. it got so bad that he started just leaving his poles laying down in the snow.one day me and a friend who had witnessed these shenanigans throughout the season and was well aware of what we were doing, were standing around with a larger group waiting for an instructor for our level 2 training. my rival came over, took his skis off put his poles down in the snow and walked into the café to get coffee. i looked at his skis, and then at my friend at said; “wouldn’t it be fun to chuck his ski up there” pointing to the large piles of snow that had collected behind a small almost decorative fence set up around the ski school to protect some trees. without hesitating my friend took the skis and walked over the fence into the piles of snow taking 2 or 3 steps and stabbed the skis into the snow maybe 4 feet behind the fence. they were hidden or anything, but they were not where you would expect them to be. unfortunately, we didn’t get to see his reaction, because we took off before he came back from getting coffee. some hours pass and we are up on the mountain skiing the lift line living the dream while training. we stop on a ledge and wait for the group to catch up. we look down at the chairlift and notice a red dot in one of the chairs. the typical color of our uniform. as it got closer, we saw a bright blue helmet on top of that red suit. we just knew it was him. i was already standing there with my friend and the other guys who saw us move his skis, and as soon as he gets with in distance... he just starts shouting at us with his thick scottish accent. i just burst out laughing, while he was just yelling at us from the chair that was slowly coming over our heads. “you know how f\*\*\*ing annoying that was?! it took me like 5 minutes to find my skis”. all the while, his client is just sitting next to him watching this entire thing unfold. as he passed over our heads he turned around in the seat and just kept on yelling at us, and we were just standing there with tears in our eyes, with a very confused instructor right next to us. we told him the story afterwards.what an absolute legends he was. i hope this brings at least a bit of a smile to your faces today, and have an awesome weekend.",9.0,0.0,CasualConversation,I have be reminisce about my time as a ski instructor with it start to snow and i think i would share my absolute favourite story from that time a few year back so i be a ski instructor while i be train for my level 1 certification i have this instructor a semiyoung scottish guy who be an absolute joy to work with always joke around and genuinely an awesome person but during the time we have him as our instructor a rivalry start between me and him he have this thing he call the first rule of a ski instructor if you leave you pole unattended he will knock them down if you stick your pole in the snow to adjust your boot bang they be now lay down just stand around and talk and you do not want to hold your pole smack they be now 5 foot away like he would not just push them down he would full on smash them if he have the chanceduring our training after have have this happen twice to me during the same training session i know i be go to be a pain in his as from then on if we be stand in line on the slope listen to him teach could i reach them and if he leave them with out his hand on them i would knock them down and he could not even be mad because he be do the same thing so he usually just take the defeat with a tired sigheither way i finish my training get my certificate and start teach but i do not stop if i saw his ski and pole outside while he be inside the ski school he would find that they be now on the ground when he come back he would always mention it every time he saw me next call me a cheeky fer and you could just see on his face that he know that he himself cause this i have a great time with it he could be with client and i would just walk over and whack them down and just continue walk it get so bad that he start just leave his pole lay down in the snowone day me and a friend who have witness these shenanigan throughout the season and be well aware of what we be do be stand around with a larger group wait for an instructor for our level 2 training my rival come over take his ski off put his pole down in the snow and walk into the café to get coffee i look at his ski and then at my friend at say would not it be fun to chuck his ski up there point to the large pile of snow that have collect behind a small almost decorative fence set up around the ski school to protect some tree without hesitate my friend take the ski and walk over the fence into the pile of snow take 2 or 3 step and stab the ski into the snow maybe 4 foot behind the fence they be hide or anything but they be not where you would expect them to be unfortunately we do not get to see his reaction because we take off before he come back from get coffee some hour pass and we be up on the mountain ski the lift line live the dream while train we stop on a ledge and wait for the group to catch up we look down at the chairlift and notice a red dot in one of the chair the typical color of our uniform as it get closer we saw a bright blue helmet on top of that red suit we just know it be him i be already stand there with my friend and the other guy who saw us move his ski and as soon as he get with in distance he just start shout at us with his thick scottish accent i just burst out laugh while he be just yell at us from the chair that be slowly come over our head you know how fing annoying that be it take me like 5 minute to find my ski all the while his client be just sit next to him watch this entire thing unfold as he pass over our head he turn around in the seat and just keep on yell at us and we be just stand there with tear in our eye with a very confused instructor right next to us we tell him the story afterwardswhat an absolute legend he be i hope this bring at least a bit of a smile to your face today and have an awesome weekend,1

318,very long rant about my debilitating depression,MauveGaze," it's gonna be very long,so i'm sorry in advance. i'd appreciate if someone could read it still,there is nothing decent happening in my life and i'm really struggling to find reasons to keep trying. thank you.i'm a 20 years old girl from italy. i've been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and debilitating depression when i was 14,i went to therapy and got medication that pretty much fucked me over. my heart started getting flutters and my obesity got worse,and they honestly didn't help at all,so i stopped going. there were many other attempts after that,but they all resulted in ''you have to take medication'' that costed me way too much,and the last therapist started ignoring my emails once i told her i wouldn't want to get on meds. so i kinda gave up. i developed an eating disorder though the years as well,which i never brought up to doctors out of shame.lately it's been particularly rough. because of my bipolar disorder,i struggle hard to keep my cyrcadian rhythm stable. last year i dropped out of high school after failing 4 years for this reason. my grades were great,i had a good relationship with my teachers and classmates,but i would miss so many days because of either not waking up in time or staying up 2 days in a row (my school wasn't in my city and i had to take 2 buses to get there,so it was just too much to handle). since then,i've lost all my friends. some people even blocked me out of nowhere,and i just don't talk to anyone but my girlfriend,which lives in america,so we only meet twice a year or so. and i'm just stuck here with no one and nothing to do.i don't have a family,nor friends,and i don't have an education or a job. because we live with only my mother's income (which is 12k a year while the avg salary in my area is 21k so for 2 people it's very low) i can't afford going back to school. normal schools won't accept me,and an equivalent will cost me more than 3k. all sort of trainings are 500 to 3000 euros and i just can't do anything. i keep applying to all sorts of jobs,even those that would worsen my health. but everyone wants people with cars or experience or degrees,even to clean toilets or work as a cashier they expect so much here. and i'm just...stuck here.  the plan is to go to the us to live with my girlfriend and build a better life for us,but until then i'm just stuck here finding reasons to live. and most of them are food and videogames. which fucking sucks. and the thing is that my dream would literally be to live in a camper,or in a cabin away from people and privileges,with barely anything but the necessary things to survive. i'm not spoiled or want a lot,i just want the bare minimum to survive.i also recently got diagnosed with pcos,and i can't afford a private doctor (the public ones are all busy with covid so they won't see me until mid 2022),and it worsens my eating disorder as  i can't lose weight easily. what prompted me to write here is exactly this. i was ready to go out for some fresh air (i'm a shut in,i leave my house like twice a month) but then i looked in the mirror and i just couldn't. my face is all spotty,i have acne,facial hair,i'm obese and i feel so awful about everything about myself. i just couldn't find the strength to actually go out and face things.i'm not looking for solutions or whatever. i know that it's pretty much impossible for me to get out of this situation.  i don't even know what i'm looking for. i just feel hopeless,i have literally nothing to do all day and i can't change anything at all. i wish i could just blame my laziness or blame the fact that i'm not trying or blame something at all. but i can't blame anything,it's just how it is and i have to accept it. and it makes it hard to live.tldr, i'm a neet with no friends,no money and an awful self image and i don't know what to do.",5.0,3.0,Depression,very long rant about my debilitating depression its go

144,i can't take it anymore. nor do i see the light. i don't wanna be alive anymore.,Mad_Human9," this might seem like a repetitive post but i'm done with my life. i'm 23 y/o. i was diagnosed with severe depression and anxiety disorder in jan 2021. i did ketamine therapy because i ventured into severe self harm. i'd cut myself badly with a razor and then smear some hand sanitizer on the fresh wound so that it would hurt more. i've been on medication since jan this year and now it all seems to fade away. i dropped out of my engineering course to start my own company. i ran that cybersecurity company for about two years, got clients and then everything went down hill. had frequent disagreements with partners and what not. then i was diagnosed with my mental illness. my partners were supportive at first but then started losing patience with me. it was hard for me to even get out of the bed let alone doing daily chores and meeting with clients. finally i decided to leave the company that i founded and now i'm just lost. a person without educational background and broken startup experience. i tried learning new things but it's becoming difficult to sustain those learning habits in a long learn. enrolled for a web developement course then left it mid way. joined the gym, then left it after a month or so. i do have some close friends but i find it inappropriate to ping them and tell them that i am sad because they've got their own lives. i'm afraid to open up to anyone. all these months of therapy and i'm back to square one. nothing has changed. i somehow get up every day, drink coffee, watch youtube all day have dinner and sleep. nothing else. i find it extremely difficult to resume my course, resume my gym and or to read my pile of books. i was an avid reader back then. used to finish ~400 page books in a week or two. i find reading very difficult now a days. everyday i'm facing self loathing issues. everyday i think what's the purpose of me doing good things to myself in the end i'm just gonna die and nothing will really matter. this keeps me from doing anything. i'm extremely fear doing something or the other thing. i'm becoming a burden on my friends and family. there's literally nothing that i do productive, i just eat, sleep and youtube all day. sometimes i go out on my own and hope a car or truck crushes the heck out of me and everything ends eventually. or i just go to a nearby lake and somehow pass the time. then the night comes and it's the same thing all over again. i feel so hopeless now a days that even if a miracle happens i'll think that it'll bring something bad with it. i wasn't a person like this before. i was a person with good mood and had a dream to live my life on my terms. although i wasn't bright in studies but always maintained good scores in science and computers. hell i even started my own cybersecurity company and ran it for two years. then someday, everything started going downhill. now here i am, having self loathing issues, and living everyday with immense suicidal thoughts. i was afraid to commit suicide earlier therefore chose to so self harm with a razor. now a days i feel even self harm isn't enough. i constantly search for least painful ways to die so that atleast when i'm dying, it won't be painful as such. i'm starting to care less about my parents and

330,i'm an introvert but i like finding common ground with strangers.,auntie007em," pre-pandemic i absolutely enjoyed traveling. didn't travel as much as i would have liked because, finances! lol. but, i did take 2 solo-ish (a month in singapore and 2 weeks in nepal) and 1 properly solo trip (2 months in nz when i was between jobs) by myself. the point was to get the most out of these once-in-a-lifetime trips - since there are still so many other places i've yet to explore. i'll admit that i have a bunch of hobbies and interests. so, the one thing i inadvertently found out while traveling, was chatting with someone who was passionate about something. and eventually realising that you actually have at least one common interest with them. i got plenty of me-time since i was largely traveling by myself, but i also socialized in a way that didn't drain me, since the conversations were interesting. solo travel doesn't have to be lonely - case in point. i remember discussions on philosophy and languages i had with hostel roommates; to bus drivers talking about their favourite destinations (since all my trips have been via public transportation for various reasons); to people manning gift shops talking about whatever they liked when i found time to kill. sure my main purpose for slow (or slow-ish) traveling was to sightsee and explore a completely different country and culture. but, when i look back now, the things that stand out the most are the lovely experiences i had with locals and fellow travellers. the quality of diverse memories make up for the lack of quantity of trips, i think. which leads me to why i posted this. as i sit at home right now, i just realised: i'm actually not sad that i'm not traveling right now. i think of it as biding my time until i can safely do so eventually. until then, i'll just keep acquiring new interests or indulging in the ones i already have. that way, i can continue to find common ground with someone who lives on the other side of the world from me. stay positive and test negative, folks! 😆",16.0,2.0,CasualConversation,I be an introvert but i like find common ground with stranger prepandemic i absolutely enjoy travel do not travel as much as i would have like because finance lol but i do take 2 soloish a month in singapore and 2 week in nepal and 1 properly solo trip 2 month in nz when i be between job by myself the point be to get the most out of these onceinalifetime trip since there be still so many other place I have yet to explore ill admit that i have a bunch of hobby and interest so the one thing i inadvertently find out while travel be chat with someone who be passionate about something and eventually realise that you actually have at least one common interest with them i get plenty of metime since i be largely travel by myself but i also socialize in a way that do not drain me since the conversation be interest solo travel do not have to be lonely case in point i remember discussion on philosophy and languages i have with hostel roommate to bus driver talk about their favourite destination since all my trip have be via public transportation for various reason to people man gift shop talk about whatever they like when i find time to kill sure my main purpose for slow or slowish traveling be to sightsee and explore a completely different country and culture but when i look back now the thing that stand out the most be the lovely experience i have with local and fellow traveller the quality of diverse memory make up for the lack of quantity of trip i think which lead me to why i post this as i sit at home right now i just realise I be actually not sad that I be not travel right now i think of it as bid my time until i can safely do so eventually until then ill just keep acquire new interest or indulge in the one i already have that way i can continue to find common ground with someone who live on the other side of the world from me stay positive and test negative folk,1

93,"life is meaningless and i don't desire to ""create my own meaning""",Particular-Lake-3684," i've recently been spending a lot of time thinking about death, what comes after it, and what that means for us as people alive right now. while i've been depressed before, i've historically been pretty high-functioning and have a stable well paying job, a loving girlfriend, good friends, and plenty of hobbies which keep me occupied. over the course of the last few weeks, i've felt lethargic, unmotivated, and extremely unattached. i don't want to talk to my girlfriend, i don't want to spend time with my roommates, i don't want to visit my family, i don't want to complete my projects at work, i don't want to work on my hobbies - everything just feels so meaningless.so to take a step back, here's my thought process:  i had a somewhat distant family member die that sparked me thinking about death. essentially, no religion, worldly discovery, or thought-process can describe what happens after death, yet i feel like something after death is ultimately the only thing that can give us meaning. i was raised christian, but even with the bible being long and thorough, it glances over what heaven would actually look like. will i still have my body? will i still know my family/friends/significant other? will i retain the same knowledge/consciousness? could i still make my own decisions? most people's fulfillment in life comes from overcoming struggle whether that means building relationships, building a family, getting a promotion, etc. but if heaven is ""perfect"" with no struggles and we're **eternally** joyful, then everything we know and understand must change for that to become possible. worse, if god isn't real, then there is nothing after death - which makes it even more meaningless. in both of these situations, most things that we do in life will ultimately not matter. if someone burns my house down, it's a terrible experience for me to have, but one that i could not possibly care about after the eternalness of death. good things are like this too. why would i work so hard to get a promotion? why should i put effort into family members or my relationships? why am i not just doing drugs over and over before i succumb to death? why should people care if i'm suffering or why should i care if others suffer if the suffering is finite and short compared to the eternalness of death? i feel like that's even cruel to ask because the concept of morality is so engrained in me (think the golden rule) why does morality matter at all if everything bad and good that happens in this life will eventually be forgotten and become meaningless. and this is where i come to you, the good and thoughtful users of reddit, to perhaps change my perspective on this last point. everywhere i read about existential depression, articles will say to ""just live in the moment and focus on today"" or ""create your own meaning"". i feel like this is akin to ""it gets better"" or ""just stick your head down and get through it"". essentially, it feels like everything in life is just a short pleasurable experience that distracts us from the absolute mystery and abstractness of death, the afterlife (whether heaven or nothing), and our purpose. i'm a logical person, and i have no desire in arbitrarily ""creating meaning"" in my life - i would just be trying to distract myself with a task that (given everything i've said) seems logically pointless. how can i make sense of the world and not dwell on my perceived meaningless of everything? note: this is just my opinion and perhaps not a fact of life. i welcome people to disagree as it may provide me the opportunity to logically escape the torment of believing this. tl/dr: death/afterlife is super long which means the good/bad of today isn't meaningful. we don't know what happens after death at all, so without knowing, everything in life feels meaningless. i'm not willing to arbitrarily ""create meaning"" and it's sucking my happiness away from me.",3.0,2.0,Depression,life be meaningless and i do not desire to create my own meaning I have recently be spend a lot of time think about death what come after it and what that mean for us as people alive right now while I have be depress before I have historically be pretty highfunctioning and have a stable well pay job a loving girlfriend good friend and plenty of hobby which keep me occupy over the course of the last few week I have felt lethargic unmotivated and extremely unattached i do not want to talk to my girlfriend i do not want to spend time with my roommate i do not want to visit my family i do not want to complete my project at work i do not want to work on my hobby everything just feel so meaninglessso to take a step back here be my thought process i have a somewhat distant family member die that spark me think about death essentially no religion worldly discovery or thoughtprocess can describe what happen after death yet i feel like something after death be ultimately the only thing that can give us mean i be raise christian but even with the bible be long and thorough it glance over what heaven would actually look like will i still have my body will i still know my familyfriendssignificant other will i retain the same knowledgeconsciousness could i still make my own decision most people fulfillment in life come from overcome struggle whether that mean build relationship build a family get a promotion etc but if heaven be perfect with no struggle and be eternally joyful then everything we know and understand must change for that to become possible worse if god be not real then there be nothing after death which make it even more meaningless in both of these situation most thing that we do in life will ultimately not matter if someone burn my house down its a terrible experience for me to have but one that i could not possibly care about after the eternalness of death good thing be like this too why would i work so hard to get a promotion why should i put effort into family member or my relationship why be i not just do drug over and over before i succumb to death why should people care if I be suffer or why should i care if others suffer if the suffering be finite and short compare to the eternalness of death i feel like that be even cruel to ask because the concept of morality be so engrained in me think the golden rule why do morality matter at all if everything bad and good that happen in this life will eventually be forget and become meaningless and this be where i come to you the good and thoughtful user of reddit to perhaps change my perspective on this last point everywhere i read about existential depression article will say to just live in the moment and focus on today or create your own meaning i feel like this be akin to it get well or just stick your head down and get through it essentially it feel like everything in life be just a short pleasurable experience that distract us from the absolute mystery and abstractness of death the afterlife whether heaven or nothing and our purpose I be a logical person and i have no desire in arbitrarily create meaning in my life i would just be try to distract myself with a task that give everything I have say seem logically pointless how can i make sense of the world and not dwell on my perceived meaningless of everything note this be just my opinion and perhaps not a fact of life i welcome people to disagree as it may provide me the opportunity to logically escape the torment of believe this tldr deathafterlife be super long which mean the goodbad of today be not meaningful we do not know what happen after death at all so without know everything in life feel meaningless I be not willing to arbitrarily create meaning and its suck my happiness away from me,0

10,ex girlfriend has been completely broken. all i wanna do is help her.,PepegaAimbot," in september my best friend/gf broke up with me. she said she had some things she needed to deal with and that she felt like she was using me as a buffer for her own issues. we had our first real fight that week. as well. it wasn't crazy or big. but it did hurt. there's 3 of us that she trusts. me and two of our friends. she isn't very close to her family. both her parents died. her father committed suicide when she was 13 and her mother died of cancer last year. (2020). she hasn't really dealt with it  she was in an emotionally abusive relationship before me. so i swore to always protect her and i tried my damn best to. she tried to break all forms of contact. she tried to push me away, gently over time but she did try. her 2 other best friends were there for her. keeping me out of the loop. we spoke a couple times here and there. but it was just her pushing me away as nicely and gently as possible. letting me down as best as she could. eventually i respected it and i haven't talked to her. i got filled in last night. by our two friends that things have gotten crazy. it started with her having a panic attack at work thinking someone was following her. one of the friends who lives near her (we'll call him ""t""). went to bring her home. she had a couple more. and she would call him for every one. eventually they admitted feelings for eachother but realised it was wrong because its just because he's there when she's vulnerable. things escalated from there. she started becoming paranoid. started doing irrational things. threatened to kill herself. her family took her in to keep watch on her. she started having multiple personalities and started talking to herself. and never making sense. she would occasionally get back to normal and talk. all this was happening while i was on a whole ""self improvement"" routine to make sure the things that had happened to me. didnt put me in the same dark place that i was in 2 years ago. (suicidal, heavy depression) i pulled myself out but i knew i was always living by walking a thin line. that i needed to make sure that things that hurt didnt oush me back over that line. they admitted her on monday. she's scared alone and broken and all i wanna do is protect her. i havent stopped crying since last night. i just want her to ne okay. i promised her id protect her and keep her safe. i wanted to give her something happy to hold onto and i failed her and it feels like i cant breathe. i just need her to be okay. i dont care if whe doesn't love me. or if she loves someone else. i chose to give her a part of me that i never wanted back. i havent slept yet. or gone into work. im 23 and so is she. she was struggling to find a job in a career field.

599,don't know what's happening to me (tw for brief mention of self harm/suicidal thoughts),BlueBone03," hi so i'm 18(f) and i've struggled with severe depression on and off for about 4 years. just looking to talk about this really as it's taking a big toll on me and isnt showing any signs of improving. about a year ago i had an episode of what i think was hypomania and then i had another episode about 9 months later which led to a bipolar 2 diagnosis which was later withdrawn. my diagnosis was then changed to major depression and cyclothymia which i didn't feel really fit me. with my depression i tend to have about two severe episodes a year in which i'm basically unable to function until they pass which can take 2-4 months. they include no motivation, feeling guilty, overall feelings of despair and hopelessness as well as self harm urges and feeling suicidal. during the most recent episode ive had i did experience paranoia and hearing external voices, which is something that seems to get more intense with each episode. i've been on antidepressants for years but have found that they don't help my depression and i actually feel like they make it worse. therapy hasn't been of use to me either as these mood changes don't seem to correlate with anything that's going on in my life, so therse nothing that's actually gone ""wrong"" for me to pin it on. i could be in the happiest place and still feel depressed if that's how my mood has decided to cycle. when i'm not in these episodes i function perfectly well, i'm able to look after myself and study without issue. i spoke to a psychiatrist in the autumn and they suggested that it was borderline personality disorder. after doing some research though i don't feel that i really identify with this as i generally think my emotions are pretty stable minus the depressive episodes. i havnt experienced any trauma and my mood episodes aren't usually anything to do with anything thats going on around me. my emotions/mood don't really fluctuate throughout the day, it's more over the course of weeks or months that i'll have changes in mood and energy. e.g. i'll be depressed for 3 months and then conpletely stable for another 3 or 4 months. i had another psychiatrist appointment today and they said that i didn't really fit the criteria for bipolar as my elated mood/hypomanic episode didn't really last long enough. my high episodes only lasted a couple of weeks at a time whereas my depression lasts months. i'm kind of stuck as to what this is. i don't feel like it's ""classic"" depression as there seems to be something else going on but i'm not sure what. any advice or thoughts are welcome :)",1.0,3.0,Depression,do not know what be happen to me tw for brief mention of self harmsuicidal thought

537,you should give your dog a massage. here’s why.,Interesting-Spinach2," if you own a dog, you need to try and give them a massage. i have a six year old german shepherd who has very mild arthritis, and i just gave him a twenty-minute body massage (focusing on his hips, shoulders and back mainly) but also gently massaging his face/neck and oh. my. god. he was so happy. he kept turning around to look at me with the biggest smile on his face. he was clearly really enjoying it. if you think about it, dogs are so active in their day-to-day life. all those long walks and games of fetch can ware their bodies down quicker than you might think. imagine how sore their muscles must get. especially for older dogs or heavier dogs, this is just something that should be a regular thing to keep them comfortable. not to mention the bonding and love it creates between dog and owner. i first started giving my dog massages about a year ago, and for some reason i forgot to for a while, but i now realize how important it is for them and their well-being. physically and emotionally. i usually do it after long hikes, or whenever i feel he needs a little extra love and attention. every time i do this he has the biggest look of love mixed with relief on his sweet little face. the way he looks at me as if to say “thank you, mom” just melts my heart. i also notice he wakes up in the morning after and seems much more energetic. i really believe this makes a difference. if you decide to try this, start off with very very gentle pressure so your dog gets used to it, and see how they react. at this point my dog loves it so much i apply a decent amount of pressure doing this (obviously pay attention and see how your dog reacts) as all dogs are different. youtube has video tutorials as well. i’m just amazed at the difference in his energy this makes. i also feel like my dog loves me even more since i started doing this. dogs do so much to love us. show them how much you love them :)(if anyone tries this with their dog, let me know in the comments how they reacted!)",151.0,20.0,CasualConversation,you should give your dog a massage here be why if you own a dog you need to try and give them a massage i have a six year old german shepherd who have very mild arthritis and i just give him a twentyminute body massage focus on his hip shoulder and back mainly but also gently massage his faceneck and oh my god he be so happy he keep turn around to look at me with the biggest smile on his face he be clearly really enjoy it if you think about it dog be so active in their daytoday life all those long walk and game of fetch can ware their body down quicker than you might think imagine how sore their muscle must get especially for older dog or heavier dog this be just something that should be a regular thing to keep them comfortable not to mention the bonding and love it create between dog and owner i first start give my dog massage about a year ago and for some reason i forget to for a while but i now realize how important it be for them and their wellbeing physically and emotionally i usually do it after long hike or whenever i feel he need a little extra love and attention every time i do this he have the biggest look of love mixed with relief on his sweet little face the way he look at me as if to say thank you mom just melt my heart i also notice he wake up in the morning after and seem much more energetic i really believe this make a difference if you decide to try this start off with very very gentle pressure so your dog get use to it and see how they react at this point my dog love it so much i apply a decent amount of pressure do this obviously pay attention and see how your dog reacts as all dog be different youtube have video tutorial as well I be just amaze at the difference in his energy this make i also feel like my dog love me even more since i start do this dog do so much to love us show them how much you love them if anyone try this with their dog let me know in the comment how they react,1

people in my country and judgmental and it's like i've lost half the battle with my profile and resume. after each interview i feel like i have no skills, and my anxiety is just makes me doubt everything. worse still is the sense of shame that compounds this fear, together they give me a crippling sense of dread at even the prospect of thinking about the future.i can't go back to live with my parents (another whole issue), but i keep going back to the thought that i'm just gonna run out of money for rent and then kill myself. recently i thought about seeing a therapist but it's really expensive in my country, and i don't trust most of my countrymen to understand anyway (hubris i know). it's a character flaw i have, i don't know how to ask for help. i've stopped talking to friends out of shame and pride.anyway, thank you if you've read all that, i haven't written my thoughts out in a while. i'm at rock bottom out here on borrowed time, but i have periods of lucidity and hope, even though it just feels like i'm temporarily blind to my impending doom.edit: i just worked up the courage to email the hr person i was in contact with for my job offer. got an automatic reply they are no longer at that organisation. fuck my life what is this shit.",1.0,0.0,Depression,jobless and struggle to get my life back on track tldr I be 29 quit my job in january be jobless since have difficulty land a job and i think I have lose all hopei have think 2021 be go to be a year id turn my life around i be burn out at the bullshit i be do at my previous job a global pr firm for 2 year join straight out of college i be give the impression that there be opportunity for career growth so i do not mind the low pay but after 2 year and have see the mess the company be in its clear its not lead anywhere not only that but the work be honestly pure bullshit i do not think i learn anything of use therei blame myself a lot for thing lead up to this whether i should have see the sign sooner be more proactive and cruised less but the truth be I be terrible at get job i have get that job because i the hiring manager be from a previous internship i think i leave good impression because I be earnest but it do make me doubt myself a lotanyway i think this would be a period of growth do online course branch into a different industry etc but the never end rejection be just crush i reach out to old contact for opportunity and some interview show promise but offer ultimately fell through in late july i be give a verbal offer email for a government job but its taking forever for approval I be still wait til todayive lose all confidence in myself and I be deathly afraid of face anymore rejection I have stop apply i feel like I have lose my grip on reality i do not know anything anymore what be i go to do with my shitty degree in political science people in my country and judgmental and its like I have lose half the battle with my profile and resume after each interview i feel like i have no skill and my anxiety be just make me doubt everything worse still be the sense of shame that compound this fear together they give me a cripple sense of dread at even the prospect of think about the futurei can not go back to live with my parent another whole issue but i keep go back to the thought that I be just go to run out of money for rent and then kill myself recently i think about see a therapist but its really expensive in my country and i do not trust most of my countryman to understand anyway hubris i know its a character flaw i have i do not know how to ask for help I have stop talk to friend out of shame and prideanyway thank you if you have read all that i have not write my thought out in a while I be at rock bottom out here on borrow time but i have period of lucidity and hope even though it just feel like I be temporarily blind to my impend doomedit i just work up the courage to email the hr person i be in contact with for my job offer get an automatic reply they be no longer at that organisation fuck my life what be this shit,0

347,transitioning from in person to online learning changed my academic career for the better,dantheeel," prior to the events that unfolded in the q1 of 2020, i found myself facing the challenges of remote learning from home and moving on from learning in person; i initially believed this to be the worst-case scenario, as all my elective courses are hands-on and encourage applied learning for students to practice real-life work skills. i contemplated the final moments of my time on campus and worried for what the future beheld for me and how i was going to make the most of my college experience online.the first couple of months proved to be an uphill battle and one that i wasn't prepared for; lectures were taught on zoom which motivated me less to attend because of the lack of resources available to the professors and how it affected their ability to teach the students. i found myself having a hard time trying to grasp the material and retain it for a period of time since most of what was taught was picked up through active recall; another reason why the environment was unwelcoming. i absolutely despised remote learning with a passion and would go on to get sub-below average grade results at the end of the spring semester. they were some of the worst final grades i've received throughout my academic career and that's what did me in and motivated me to discipline myself and prove that i was a better student than this and that no sort of learning environment will change the potential i bring to the table.after the letdown that was the spring semester, i immediately, without hesitation enrolled in two general education courses elsewhere that were required for my program. i didn't know what to make of these courses but i told myself that no matter the circumstance, i will do what is required for me to obtain the highest possible grade. they were not courses that were well-rounded and suited for my major, but i still knew that the best thing to do was suck it up, and get the job done, and i can thankfully say that i did just that. i pushed myself to put in the time, dedication, and effort, to obtain the highest level of satisfaction and redemption. i was engaged, committed, and intrigued by what i was learning and managed to apply most/all aspects of the course content that was being covered. thanks to this change in attitude and perspective, i was able to position myself for success and work through all the hard comings from beginning to end, earning an overall a grade in both courses.after the summer classes were done, i enrolled in three elective courses with the same mindset; be proactive when the opportunity arises, and push myself to achieve what i most desire. while these classes proved to be more of a challenge than the last two in the spring semester, i was able to make the most out of all of them. i attended all the necessary zoom lectures and listened to the professors give their wisdom and insight which i applied for myself. the hardest shortcoming for me at the time was learning from reading the textbook; as stated previously, active recall wasn't my strong suit and something i lacked which meant i had to find alternative ways to pick up on lecture notes. but the semester overall went satisfactory and i exceeded my expectations for the semester by a long shot; it was so well recognized that one of my professors from the college sent me a letter of recognition as follows, ""great work in cis 130 dan! i have been teaching computer technology for over 40 years and you have been the best that i have had. not only are you bright. i have had bright students before but they didn't work hard- you did! many bright students could not articulate what they learned; you did an excellent job with your reports. it'll be my honor to recommend you for jobs or future degrees."" not only did that professor boost my academic performance, but he also helped me obtain my first ever certification (testout's ""certified pc pro""); it became one of the most memorable moments in my academic career.the final semester for the once dreaded but now enjoyed online learning environment was in the summer of 2021 in which i enrolled in only two classes. these two classes were one step above the previous three but didn't deter my ability to perform. they lasted only from june to august, which meant more demand and potential to bring to the table, which i did. the workload became overwhelming in some parts of the curriculum, but i kept my cool and retained the disciplinary attitude for a good cause. in the end, i finished strong with convincing test scores and final grades. this was the final time i would take an online class, and i'm now reflecting back on it and it now makes me cherish those feats that i pulled off before.working remotely from home wasn't on everyone's bucket list, and while many suffered the harsh reality of it all, some people like myself took it as an opportunity for redemption and going beyond one's limits to reach new heights and achieve great feats that nobody could've imagined. this global pandemic proved that one can make the most out of an unlikely situation if enough heart and motivation is the driving force for one to succeed. i now am thankful for the remote experience and being under lockdown as it taught me that good things happen to those who dedicate their lives to what they desire most. i will never forget the uplifting experience that online learning has brought to me.",6.0,0.0,CasualConversation,transition from in person to online

alcohol habit to try and cope -began getting multiple vitamin deficiencies as a result of the eating disorder -and was pretty freaking close to ending it at several points during the semester despite that i finished out the semester. i don’t know if i’ll pass my classes (thank goodness for grade curves) but i’m completely 100 percent burned out. if i don’t pass one out of any of these classes it means i need to come back fall of next year, which will tack on another semesters worth of tuition which, frankly, i can’t afford. so my final grades essentially make or break my grad school career. before you ask, i’ve reached out to student services and got in touch with a counselor. she connected me to several options within my insurance but because of how tight my cash is i can’t afford the copays for the treatment she wants me to get. because of high demand there’s only so much the health center can offer me. i think the worst part out of all of this is that i feel like i can’t tell people. everyone here at the university is so groomed and professional and are just…amazing. i feel like a rotten sack of potatoes in comparison, and if i share my struggles i feel like that only furthers it. plus with so few friends to talk to…well…my family and friends back home have some idea of what is going on, but they don’t know the day to day of it, how it’s so hard for me to sleep and i’m dizzy and trembling all the time, that i start crying at the smallest of inconveniences, that it’s gotten progressively harder to take care of myself. i’m so tired all the time that after simply sweeping my tiny studio i had to sit down and breathe because i was so tired. each task feels monumental. i can’t let them know. i don’t want to worry them, i don’t want to deal with the guilt of not

451,"i used to have a very irritating and nitpicking coworker, and it almost drove me crazy",yeaurossoe," back at my previous job, i had this coworker who liked to nitpick on others, and did things that made our lives difficult. he wasn't a bad worker, i mean he was competent, got his tasks done, and was not error-prone. but it was his personality at work that annoyed us. we worked in a large lab, dealing with processing specimens shipped from across the region, routing them to different labs. the first thing this guy did when we started work was to call each and every coworker's desk phone, ensuring that nobody has diverted their line to another line (sometimes we divert phone lines as we may not be at our station all the time, or we prefer to work at a different station). if he found out that your line was diverted away, he'd shout ""xxx, don't escape your responsibility, take your line back please"" in a very loud tone, and then nagged about how he had to check everybody's phone lines to make sure everybody did their job. then, while everybody was busy with their work, he would check other coworkers' work, and then be very vocal with ""hey, you did not scan the form!"" ""hey, where are your entries?"" ""hey, why did you leave this on the desk?"". when its time for lunch break, sometimes he'd sit at the pantry, discreetly observing other coworkers coming in for lunch, and record what time they came in for lunch and what time they returned to work. he'd then compile those data and send an email to the manager complaining us for taking longer lunches than company's stipulated lunch minutes. and he'd always do this sneaky stuff -- if there's something he didn't like about you, he wouldn't say it to you, instead, he'd leave anonymous messages in places like a post-it note in your drawer, or even a string of message written in the username field of your pc lock screen… then, when someone decided to pull an eye for an eye to teach him a lesson, he threw himself into a rage and the manager had to spend a few hours of his time to calm him down. he was a good worker, so the company can't really do anything to get rid of him, but his interpersonal skills were so bad that he always had one of the lowest ratings during our annual performance review. and he'd always blame his low rating on others for sabotaging his ""good"" deed. i have since moved on to another job and has lost contact with my coworkers there, so i don't know whether he's still there torturing other coworkers.",4.0,5.0,CasualConversation,i use to have a very irritating and nitpicking coworker and it almost drive me crazy back at my previous job i have this coworker who like to nitpick on others and do thing that make our life difficult he be not a bad worker i mean he be competent get his task do and be not errorprone but it be his personality at work that annoy us we work in a large lab deal with processing specimen ship from across the region rout them to different labs the first thing this guy do when we start work be to call each and every coworkers desk phone ensure that nobody have divert their line to another line sometimes we divert phone line as we may not be at our station all the time or we prefer to work at a different station if he find out that your line be divert away he would shout xxx do not escape your responsibility take your line back please in a very loud tone and then nag about how he have to check everybodys phone line to make sure everybody do their job then while everybody be busy with their work he would check other coworkers work and then be very vocal with hey you do not scan the form hey where be your entry hey why do you leave this on the desk when its time for lunch break sometimes he would sit at the pantry discreetly observe other coworkers come in for lunch and record what time they come in for lunch and what time they return to work he would then compile those data and send an email to the manager complain us for take longer lunch than company stipulate lunch minute and he would always do this sneaky stuff if there be something he do not like about you he would not say it to you instead he would leave anonymous message in place like a postit note in your drawer or even a string of message write in the username field of your pc lock screen then when someone decide to pull an eye for an eye to teach him a lesson he throw himself into a rage and the manager have to spend a few hour of his time to calm him down he be a good worker so the company can not really do anything to get rid of him but his interpersonal skill be so bad that he always have one of the lowest rating during our annual performance review and he would always blame his low rating on others for sabotage his good deed i have since move on to another job and have lose contact with my coworkers there so i do not know whether he still there torture other coworkers,1

attention and easily gain reassurance from others of their love and care for me.since we were kids, we learned to give our love and support to those going through difficult times, even strangers. this is one of the great things about people, and we do it with the intention of lifting others up. but sometimes it can do just the opposite. everyone falls down sometimes, and it's always reassuring to know that others will be alongside you to help you up. ideally, we are helped up to do the same for others, and it snowballs from there. in that world, everyone eventually ends up on their feet. but in reality, our paths are full of sticks and branches that will inevitably trip us up again. and surely, someone will always walk by to help you back up. you can come out of this with gratitude toward that person and the desire to do the same for others. or you can come out with the realization that tripping over a stick is all you need for someone to help you. people who naturally feel gratitude will get right back on their feet and continue on the path, helping others up along the way. but the other people will go out of their way to find a stick. and they eventually learn that laying on the ground is good enough, as long as you can convince others there was a stick in the way. soon after that, they convince themselves the stick was actually there.of course life isn't just a dirt path with some sticks in the way, it's a complex experience with lots of moving parts. nonetheless it’s a good way to explain what i believe i am experiencing.before i was depressed, there were times where i would act sad around friends or family just so they could reassure me that they loved and cared for me. i could have had a valid reason for it, but i would tend to blow it out of proportion. or i would make something up completely. this is the part where i was convincing others there was a stick in the way.the more i did this, the more of a habit it became and the more i started to convince myself in my own argument. i was looking for sticks for so long i eventually started seeing sticks that weren't there. i started to believe the lies i was telling others. it got to the point where i no longer need to act sad to get some reassurance, i was sad. i convinced myself.i am not sure how big of a role this played in getting me to where i am today, but i think it is a significant factor.

903,why is it so hard to let go ?,yaxir," if you browse my reddit history ( and you may, i have no shame admitting who i was ) , i was a porn addict and a masturbation addict with some seriously taboo and forbidden fetishesi started nofap in mid 2016 and eventually, i was able to rid myself of the porn masturbation addictionhowever - in the process of getting rid of my addiction, i noticed i became something of a 'dopamine junkie' , similar to **adrenaline junkies** ( but i am addicted to feeling good as opposed to always wanting an adrenaline rush , which i also enjoy btw )i will explain briefly what i mean by being a dopamine junkie - so, on days my dopamine is probably at good levels , i will feel great and be capable to do anything in life .. absolutely anything. i will be the most optimistic man alive on earth. if i listen to songs i like, esp emotional and witty ones , i even start getting feelings of falling in love spontaneously even though i don't have a gf/wife ( and this coming from a pakistani guy, who was very shy and for a long time lived in a society where pre-marital sex and dating and casual relationships were all considered strictly forbidden taboos ). everything just feels so great !on days my dopamine takes a hit, everything goes to hell. everything becomes really bad. i don't enjoy the songs i listen to. the activities i usually enjoy doing .. i still do kind of enjoy but there's this sense of feeling rotten from within , this feeling that 'something is missing' and that i should not be happy because something needs to be done, something i must do to feel happyfor instance, this guy who's my compatriot and who i met for the first time in an event at the campus i am currently living at and well , he asked me about where did i gain my bachelor degree from ( in pakistan) and i told him about my uni and also added that it's a top unis in the country. since he wasn't from my city in pak, he mildly disputed that other universities in pakistan are top and that deep down made me upset. i was there to enjoy the event, not to argue about my alumnus ( which i am confident is one of the best )i am really , really upset i couldn't come up with a comeback and shortly after, he left with his friendsi am upset i did not confront him when i had the chanceand because of this i am really having a hard time feeling goodi am really really upset that i don't feel good anymorei know that if i had given him an answer or confronted him , i would have felt 'great' and it would have felt like a win .. my inability to get a 'win' from that situation has my entire self very, very upset from withini could easily let go of such things when i was a young boy .. why can't i do the same as an adult ? what changed, what happened that letting go has become a markedly tough challenge for me ?why does happiness feel so transient .. why is it so fragile and uncertain ? why can't i have a stable and firm state of happiness in my mind ?i had felt so better earlier in the week because things had gone favorably, i had flirted with a few girls on campus and it felt great .. i felt absolutely on top of the world ?why do i feel so horrible , so inadequate , so insecure and so terrible now ?i am just trying to be a better mani fought depression all by myself from age 13-14 till age 15/16 , from age 13 till age 16 i faced 4 deaths and stood over 3 graves in 4 years and i didn't know how to grieve and no one taught me how tobecause apparently men don't cry in my culture or it's considered a taboo for guys to cry in seasian culturesor male kids are kept in the dark about relatives with terminal diseases until those relatives die a horrible death and only after their deaths do we get to know wtf was wrong and by that time we don't know how to grieve and even when we try to grieve minutes after that relative's death some asshole aunt tells us to console their son who was clearly older than me but when i told this to others they  expected me to have the guts and the street smarts at age 13/14 to tell that asshole aunt off .. which i couldn't because i was fucking 13/14, so on that horrible day i consoled her son when i should have cried myself and cried a lot  but that one day badly altered my mental healthand because **i did not cry that day** .. my own grief just stayed in my head and tortured me with depression and inability to express emotion / grief for a long time .. i was psychologically paralyzed but no one ever took me to grief counselling or to a mental health doctor ( psychologist / psychiatrist - i presume there's a significant difference b/w the two ) because such things are still not taking seriously in my home country ( some country that is  son of b\*tch )i had some really tough times in academics in my teens and even in my undergrad .. real tests of my mental fortitude , and i got through them amid a lot of sufferingso then why can't i let go now .. i thought with age, came maturity ? with age, came calm and wisdom in a man's disposition ? why then, do i still suffer ?why is this happening ? why can't i just lead a normal social life .. why does life have to be filled with twists and turns for me .. why does it have to be so fucking tricky for mei just want to be happy again , i am loyal to my family and especially my parents who apart from the mental health fiasco, have done alot for me .. i never wanted a painful and mentally uncertain lifewhy then , can't i let go of what that ill-informed pakistani idiot said to me about my university, at the campus event a couple of days ago ?it shouldn't be that big of a deal .. it's his lack of knowledge that he doesn't know about  good universities in his country, why am i taking this so seriously ?am i sick ?p.s : please, please don't tell me to masturbate to gain relief - you really think i didn't try that ? it only made the problem worse and made me 'run' from my problems rather than facing them or confronting them ,

14,i am so ready to give up,bremw01," i am 20 years old, the last four years of my life have been drastically changed in a way thats been even more traumatizing because of cps involvement, a foster sister, and now her baby. my mom immediately chose to adopt him after my foster sister abandoned him.before this my mom and i used to have a a really close relationship. i used to not be miserable, since the baby was born all i want to do is end my life. i cry and cry and cry about what once was, what it was supposed to be. i cry every day for hours at a time some days, i cry at work, with friends, while doing hobbies. i cry when im next to mh mom or near the baby. ive told her over and over that i think our relationships broken beyond repair, that i cant get over this.my mom is disabled and lives on 800$-900$ a month income, has trouble feediing herself on somedays, amd accidentally neglected me often due to multiple sclerosis and bipolar disorder and severe depression. she is now taking care of this infant and saying she will be able to do it. she couldnt even care for me properly when she was healthier. i wanted to spend my teens with her, my foster sisters court cases, constant need for attention,negging stripped all that away.my mom kept saying that it would end soon, it never did, with the baby it never will. i just want my mom so so so so bad. i just cant do this anymore. i am too autistic to live with children and babies and had to move out of my own home. i miss her so much. it hurts so bad. there is a hole in my heart that wont go away. i cant cope

go back to when inwas a child, it wasnt good then but i still had her. me and her were always so close. i have broken heart symdrome because of this and was fainting because of the pain at one poijnt. the only thing that helps is drinking. i drink from the bottle and smoke an insane amount of weed to just get me through the day without killing myself. i dont feel much of anything towards life that makes me want to push forward. everything i dreamt of has been destroyed by this, my disability, the pandemic. it all at once. its just awful. i wake up everyday ready to go back to bed or just cry. i stay alive because i have responsibilities to my boyfriend, cats, an friends. my depressions been to bad to feel anything positive about the future, i am doing my best but i cant anymore. the reposnsibility of a relationshiop, friendships, and upkeeping an apartments too much. this was the last straw. i just cant.i was in therapy and the therapist reported me being raped as a kid to cps. i

849,am i not enough?,Ok-Reflection-4536," i really dont know what to say just find this r/depression and thought that i can post in here for your honest opinions here. and sorry english is not my primary language so if there will be any grammar typo i am sorry then. so here we go:i am 14 years old boy and i just think i am not enough, the reasons may be: 1.my lack of empathy:i even had suspect that i might be a sociopath but idk i just cant imagine what may love feels like, when i have chance always like to pickpocket something or lie to them.i am also hurting animals like not that i can rip of cat head just when i see a snail,bug or mouse like to step on them until they last breath, rip of pigeon wing so he wont be hopeless and gomna be trying to fly again but cant so he just gonna pass away slowly and painfully and i enjoyed it.no one knows anything about this and i am gonna keep it that way this is my secret i am gonna take to my grave.but i am a bit innocent because as i did my reaserch its a mental illness that you can have by your own genes or naturally,learnt it for some reason.for me i was good until like 13 where it started its because my parents i am not saying there are bad its just ...: when they scream at me i didnt cry because they will scream at me even more because i am ""girly"" or ""what man even cry"" or getting angry because then they will slap me, punch me but that was quite rare they usually be like one week not talking to me, making fun of me, screaming at me for no reason and take my belogings like my mobile, old pc, and when i get c in school they will making fun of me infront of family members but just when i am standing right next to them.so long story short because of this i wasnt angry or sad i was like a fucking robot and was holding up my emotions this cause this ""lack of emphaty"" i have today.not any guilt, not any feelings not any happiness from that moment.2. i am not ""big"" : while everyone in my school is already doing workouts and someone has a sloghtly six pack i just cant do it also i am obese like i have about 80kg and 170cm.which is another thing i am short like everyone is taller than me and sometimes making fun of me for it, i dont blame them i would do the same its not abou them i feel like i am short even without them.3.i am bisexual: its not reason why would i kill myself or blame me for it no one knows about except me at least i hope.its just sometimes makes question myself about who i really am like i like porn and gay porn but who am i? i just dont know the answer and hope one day i am gonna find it.4.i am ugly: well when i say i am ugly i mean it like lets go from face to toes:a.i got big noseb.i got pimples( but i hope its just part of puberty) c.i got the thing idk how to call it, its just at any time i will feel pain in my eyes and they or just one my eye will start ""crying""? not crying and sobbing just like water or something that shit aint going down like whem i am crying its going a bit on a side and its not salty like tears.d.i have scars on my tongue, my whole tongue is literally just like 3 big scars 7 regular scars and 10 mini scars i didnt do them they are here from my birth and most people tell me i am something like"" disgusting creature"" or ""gross""e. i got ugly facef.i have hair on my entire body,not just ""oh my i have ass hair"" i have hair everywhere on my toes, belly, face, neck, even my finger , my fucking fingers!5.i am poorto specify this i am not exactly poor i know out there are people who have it 1000x worse than me. by poor i mean i dont have money for anything i want to do for example:1.hobbys:no matter what hobby i have, like i was trying to learn programming from c++,c# and python but my pc broke also i would love to lean digital drawing or of course gaming, but my parents ""accidentally"" broke my pc and accused me for breaking it in half(i had a notebook with like intel core 2 duo and 128mb vram)and when grandma said she will buy me one for christmas my dad  sculded her and said that i will have my pc when i earn money for it myself like bitch what the actual fuck you dont even giving me pocket money and i am 14 i cant have a job. and if you are curios yes they have money they have something above 15 000€ in account but still refuse to buy me anything i want. but they are buying me food and paying for water so at least i should greatfull for that some people straggle to live because they dont have anything to eat and i am crying here like ""i dont have money for my gaming pc"" so i see the irony.i of course have other hobbys like lockpicking ( no i am not a robber),shooting with airgun or space, every time i see stars and night sky i get so much emotional would love to have like something like binocurals so i can see it. but again no money, and its not like they are ""niggards"" they give my one year less old ister piano and guitar because she wanted it.or bigger room like a lot bigger than mine. or they bought her a new pc because she wants she is behaving like me,we are the opposite of stereotype sister and brother are natural enemies and she got same grades as me maybe even worse. i wonder why is she better than me but maybe its just like their ""favorite"" child for some reason.and that is about it that i am ugly and will never have boyfriend/girlfriend i know that its not even making me sad because i think i am sociopath and i cant feel love.which is also positive because many people are these ""feelings"" to others pulling down and then they are sad or depressed about it.and that i am bisexual yeah for me its just weird being attracted to both genders. the main reaon why i dont even know if i have depression or just being suicudial i am sad and i am cring and sobbing to my pillow right now but i dont wanna die is: the 5 reason because of lack financial silupport or materials i feel like i am wasting time in my life while i am young enough.its not like i want to rule fucking world in my 14 i just the things that interested me i cant do (my hobbys) even if i can i need time to develop skill on them like if i have infinite money maybe in 20-25 i would be really skillful in all my hobbyes but lets say i will start working like in 18 and graduete the school still cant buy a fucking pc because we have bad electricity which cost maybe 2000€ to repair but parents say no and then when i want something like a new lamp with i can see some shit they will say no and use bad electeicity as a excuse for ""why not""? so in summary am i wasting time in 14

have no way of knowing what's actually going on because he never hangs out with me anymore and hasn't responded to my texts. i can't ask any of his friends what happening because i don't know them very well, and even if i did i don't think a bunch of 24 year olds would snitch on their friend. he promised for the past three sundays to take me to the beach. it hasn't happened. my ex has started showing up at events that im at, and at my friends houses. i cannot tell them to fuck off because they are also friends with my friends, and even though i have known my friends longer than my ex has, i don't think my friends have the heart to exclude them. my ex emotionally destroyed me, was constantly high all the time, and cheated on me multiple times, but they are trans, and i fear any criticism of them will be misread as transphobia, despite the fact i helped at one point fund their transition and even gave them some of my old clothes and makeup to wear. it physically sickens me to be in the same room as them. they have not changed in my eyes (sobriety wise or in how they treat their relationships), but i feel like i have to put up with them if i can keep my friends.i am failing school because i have no meds. i tried to function without them i really did. i can do my job without my meds, but school i really found them useful. i was an a student and i only just passed this quarter with c's. i gained weight. i cannot get to my gym because of work most of the time, and because the main sport i did before covid was extremely close contact, i haven't been able to find any classes that are available to teach it. i can't stop eating, and i can't stop avoiding food at the same time. some days ill eat the cabinets clean, and then cry myself to sleep. and the other days i feel repulsed by food. i wear the same hoodie every day because its the only thing that hides how i look. i used to really like myself. now the doctor says im at risk for developing pcos. my partner before disappearing did not hide the fact he hasn't really enjoyed the weight gain. my epilepsy got worse. this means i can't drive. ive been trying to get my license for five years. i failed to qualify to get one again because i had another seizure. i don't have the money to get a service dog. i tried to save but i still don't have enough. my dad is showing signs of possible dementia, and it doesn't help he himself experiences depression. siblings are broken up despite me having a large family. the worst part is i have no friends at school. i can't live on campus because of my epilepsy so i only go twice a week. i am a transfer student. i haven't been able to meet anyone interested in hanging out with me. i tried to go to clubs, and i tried being friendly in class. i made one acquaintance and it was a nice boy who let me see his notes after i was sick one week. but he apparently just graduated and moved back to his home country. so i can't even see him next quarter and make a new pal.i can't get up anymore. my room is a mess. job is the only thing i engage in anymore, and it is filled with screaming children and karens. my head constantly hurts, i am so scared of everything. i don't know how to deal with this anymore but i need to know because im all my parents have left. what do i do. how do i find balance. how do i make it stop. how do i find

302,i want advice or an opinion on how i should approach my current situation.,cezarzq," let's start with the beginning, let's see where i went wrong or where i'm wrong.i had a relationship, in which i started making sacrifices, i took second place and i didn't see any other priorities in life.when i met this person i decided to go back to the remote job that allowed me to support myself and lead an ok life.the situation changed shortly, i gave up the remote job for a full time position.work schedule 7 am-7pm, office work, very stressful and with quite high pressures from the employer, i said i make this sacrificeto be able to be happy and to be able to support myself and my partner since then.it was good for a while, but the situation changed over time and i didn't have time to get home very tired and without any desire.knowing that i stay at work for so many hours, i expected when i got home to find a plate of hot food and to be able to rest.but the situation was not like that at all, i slowly started to change my mind, i specify that i kept the house and everything related to us, i limited myself to see her happy.soon i began to open my eyes and look in the mirror at how much i had changed for a person i thought would be with me.i know from my previous relationships that as a mature person when he sees that the other person is making sacrifices, you try to be with him and get over the problems together.i started to get cold when i saw them coming to my house and someone had other occupations than the small duties of a person living in a house,i did not impose it on anyone and i will never do it.but i had a few expectations to see a little cleaning in the house, a plate of hot food and clean clothes.do you think i'm asking too much of the relationship?as a man, i took care of these aspects on my own since i was 7 years old, i learned that i have to deal with being alone at the parties and only one parent who took care of me, found it difficult to be a mother. but life goes on.at the age of 16, i was hired for the first time, because the material situation at home put my father under a stress that i did not want to cause.given that he was alone and raised me, i could not ask for more than i was offered and i learned to appreciate what i receive.returning to the current situation, i found that the relationship is toxic trying to talk and tell me the point of view maybe we can fix the situation.but it became more convenient to reproach me.she soon used the car i was using for work, involving her in an accident with total damage due to her fault and leaving me without a means of transportation.i decided to stop the relationship and see each other on the road, because i lost more than 7 kg in one month which created some medical problems for me.now going back to the current situation, on the position i am working on now i have pressure from very big bosses, certain conditions in the contract are not respected,if i want to discuss them, i have two options, either they write my resignation or they fire me.the problem now is that i am looking for a new job, but i can't find myself anymore, i feel very tired, i don't have the right to be able to stay at home to rest for a while.i haven't had a relationship in a year, i'm not focused on this aspect because i have other priorities in life, at least the medical situation stresses me a lot and i can't do anything yet because i need another source extra income so i can handle it.the management of the company has a wrong approach towards employees, subjected to pressure, unpaid work with additional schedule and the continuous list ... which make me start quite a bit to give up and look for another job.at the moment i do not have a material and financial security with which i can support myself, in parallel i am working on a portfolio for the presentation of my projects and hoping that i will be able to find some work, maybe with a health insurance or more benefits, which can help me. in the future.my question is the following, i see life with different eyes, i have other expectations or it's just the toxic environment and i have to make some changes to be able to recover.how do you see the situation and what advice can you give me to put on a smile and maybe i can see the full side of the glass as honestly i only see a black light at the end of the tunnel.if you have advice, opinions in which direction i can focus -

677,"please read it, i need someone",dokutatenma," i'm very sorry for a long post, but i beg, beg you to read it. i just need someone, i feel so alone right now. i don't know if i'm falling into depression, but i've noticed that i'm currently feeling sad and broken very often. this was happening to me for the entire life for some short periods, but now i feel it gets worse. it's not that i can't get out of bed to do stuff or something, or i'm constantly sad, i have very very rare mood swings, like every day for few hours i will be happy and the rest of it i'm sad or numb. i wouldn't say i'm suicidal, but you will probably say i am, after this post, because i think that suicide is not a very bad option generally if you can't do anything, but i guess it sucks. it's currently better to me to live even miserably than to just die. (probably because of the moments i feel happy)i already coped with some of my insecurities, for some longer time i've struggled with them, but some are still there. i'm 19 and i think i don't look good even tho i'm really trying. for example my nose is big and ugly, and i've had some acne (still have them, but way less because i fought it with some skin-care, healthy eating etc.) even tho i don't want to think that way, sometimes i think that's why i dont get close connections with people.also, i'm very bad with people. i don't know if i can rate my social skills. with the people i know and i love i'm talkative, but i'm just scared of new people. for example, it happens that grocery worker tell me something random criticising me i'm slow or something like that and it changes my mood and make me nervous or sad. my fear or new people is the reason i didn't post these kind of posts before, but i wanted. actually, i did, but with way less details and in some comment sections, and people gave me 0 support (actually they were negative). i got 0 advice, just criticism. also, in all honesty, i don't really like new people. i must know someone well to like him, but i don't like 90% of new people i meet.but all that is not the reason i'm sad. it's just the way i am and i know it can get better. my worst thought right now is that i'm worth nothing. i feel non-defined, i feel that nobody besides my parents care for me. i have some friends, actually more than you would think for a person like me but i think nobody actually cares for me that much. i have no best friend. the best explanation would be that i don't feel i belong anywhere. i have a group of friends (15-20+ of us, and surely about 10 are my very good friends) and we play football often (now not that much because it's winter), but the thing that makes me sad is that there are some groups of us, like few groups of 3-4+ people that are ""best friends"". i belong in none of these, that's what kills me.maybe everyone of you would tell me that i'm not worth nothing because:\- i have friends and i'm in contact with them daily, sometimes we talk on discord, play games, play football etc.\- now at 19 i have online part-time programming job and i earn respectable amount (at least for my country) of money, working for $20/hour, i made 3000+$ since i started with freelance work some time ago \- im attending the second best college in my country, studying computer science (although i didn't have any exams yet, and i'm afraid i won't do good, but i'm studying more often (almost didn't study at all in high-school, just when needed for test but somehow managed to finish with all a-s (5.00 in my country), my talent for math got me in college , also ranked very high on the list))\- i love football, playing it and watching it. i support barca and few other teams and really like to watch games, but i still like more to play it, and i'm okay in it. also looking forward to go attend live games at england, spain, or somewhere when i get some more money\- also have some other activities, love watching anime, i'm now watching house md, love playing games (i'm very good and cs:go and love playing fifa)\- i'm physically active, often play sports, started to go to gym, often walking etc. not because i want to be healthy, just because i love itbut at the moment i just honestly feel all of that is worth nothing. if i wasn't there, there would be no difference. if i killed myself, there would be no difference. my parents would be devastated (that's mostly what's keeping me from doing this, but chill i'm really not near suicide, i just point) and my friends would be sad for few weeks. i feel like i'm not here, my presence is unimportant. that made me doubt my life decisions. why do i study computer science? it's not gonna help anyone, i will get money for me and my family but that's it. maybe i should have been a doctor? at least that way i would be worth something, i would help people.i am generally considered as lazy person, but i don't know if i really am. currently, i have zero motivation for everything. everything i do isn't just worth it, why do i even do it? i also moved to my new flat in the capital city, but there i feel 3x more alone and unmotivated. i know my parents care for me but they are both old and have their own problems. my mother struggles with anxiety and is on benzos for 15 years. actually i tried her meds (i'm not addicted, still at least) and it makes me feel better in a day (she has unlimited supply). when i take it, i feel that my bad thoughts are gone, but it's not the solution for my problems. the other problem i didn't mention is that i was feeling anxious last few weeks too. about things like my grades, studying, fear of losing job (not that big of a problem actually), but some other things someone would say are stupid. for example, maybe will sound stupid, but one example is i watch one tv show now (house) and it makes me feel good, but i'm really afraid i will get very sad when it ends and feel even more alone and fall into depression.i feel like i wanna move out somewhere (currently can't obviously, but maybe in the future), maybe to england, but also one of my insecurities is that my english is bad, even though i've been actively trying to learn it for several years. also i had some self diagnoses for myself, i think i have adhd (i really struggle concentrating, also several other symptoms i won't go into details) for example, but i know that i shoudn't be self-diagnosing myself.about love life, that's the very bad part. i'm not sure of my sexuality, but that doesn't matter. people could think i'm asexual because i almost never talked about it, but i'm not. i have one crush now for almost 2+ years and we are friends and will never be anything more, but when we get in argument and not talk for some time im feeling very sad, although we will never be together, i wanna keep that person as my life-long friend but i can't seem to manage doing it. never contacts me, i'm always the one who calls first, and we seem to be okay, but if i try to move on and not call for few months, i can't get over it, i think about that person, and how we had great times before, and now the person doesn't like me like before (never liked me in sexual way, we were just like best friends but i was okay with it, as long as we spend time together, called me often then, but now that's changed, even though i didn't try anything more). reason i'm that stuck with them is because when i had really bad time few years ago, that person was the only one who wanted to really be friends with me (not because they knew i was struggling, actually didn't know, but just liked me, though i was funny, like playing and talking with me), like best friend, would always call me to go on discord, play something, but now it isn't like that and i'm sad because of it, and i know i must move on.i probably forgot many many things, but i hope i noted some important points. even now writing this post i feel pathetic, and that people will criticise me more, tell me that i don't have problems, but i really do feel bad and i know i must change it, but i wrote it and i will post it, so whatever happens, happens. thank you.",1.0,0.0,Depression,please read it i need someone I be very sorry for a long post but i beg beg you to read it i

supply when i take it i feel that my bad thought be go but its not the solution for my problem the other problem i do not mention be that i be feel anxious last few week too about thing like my grade study fear of lose job not that big of a problem actually but some other thing someone would say be stupid for example maybe will sound stupid but one example be i watch one tv show now house and it make me feel good but I be really afraid i will get very sad when it end and feel even more alone and fall into depressioni feel like i want to move out somewhere currently can not obviously but maybe in the future maybe to england but also one of my insecurity be that my english be bad even though I have be actively try to learn it for several year also i have some self diagnosis for myself i think i have adhd i really struggle concentrate also several other symptom i will not go into detail for example but i know that i shoudnt be selfdiagnosing myselfabout love life that be the very bad part I be not sure of my sexuality but that do not matter people could think I be asexual because i almost never talk about it but I be not i have one crush now for almost 2 year and we be friend and will never be anything more but when we get in argument and not talk for some time I be feel very sad although we will never be together i want to keep that person as my lifelong friend but i can not seem to manage do it never contact me I be always the one who call first and we seem to be okay but if i try to move on and not call for few month i can not get over it i think about that person and how we have great time before and now the person do not like me like before never like me in sexual way we be just like best friend but i be okay with it as long as we spend time together call me often then but now that be change even though i do not try anything more reason I be that stuck with them be because when i have really bad time few year ago that person be the only one who want to really be friend with me not because they know i be struggle actually do not know but just like me though i be funny like play and talk with me like best friend would always call me to go on discord play something but now it be not like that and I be sad because of it and i know i must move oni probably forget many many thing but i hope i note some important point even now write this post i feel pathetic and that people will criticise me more tell me that i do not have problem but i really do feel bad and i know i must change it but i write it and i will post it so whatever happen happen

838,and winter has taken hold,Bigmealplantime," last few days i’ve felt that slump into a deep winter depression, and far worse than past years. i don’t know if i can make it through one more. it’s extra tough because winter always turns me into a miserable person who ends up losing friends and previous accomplishments. i don’t even know how many subs here i was banned from last winter, it’s embarrassing. i still get dms from people telling me off which just worsens things. i’ve consistently lost a girlfriend every one of the last few winters. last winter led to me losing my entire friend group (namely because one guy threw me to the street when i needed help most, and then returned my ativan script to me, which i asked him to hold for me so i wouldn’t touch it). naturally everything spiraled and i spent most of this year friendless and locked up inside. i work from home and the pandemic has made my neighborhood in nyc far too dangerous - sirens every 5-10 min (no joke) and citizen showing half a dozen or more nearby shootings every night. i try super hard when i fall off track to get back into my career, my fitness routine, a healthy diet, and not forgetting my meds. i’m on nardil (you know, the last resort when even ect won’t work) and now t3/cytomel as well and it’s still not enough. i’ve spent the last few days in bed sobbing and shivering from the cold (half the tenants moved out so i think the landlord cut the heat a bit this year). my friend and neighbor next door just moved out, and i have 3 friends left here who i don’t get to see much. this isn’t a suicide call for help but i don’t see the point in life when the ratio of good to bad is so poor. i had an amazing 2020 despite most, and i’m so grateful for that. 2021 has been a horrible year loaded with deaths, people leaving me, sickness, health problems, weight gain, and a general lack of activity. at one point, i calculated an average of 3 weeks between bad things happening. given my strong feeling that more bad things are coming, it’s either going to be my girlfriend or job i lose next. she’s absolutely wonderful and very supportive, and i co-own a business, but i’m sure both will drop out on me as well, just like everything else. my doctors and therapist have been concerned, but i can’t get into a ketamine study or afford to go to a clinic for it. i’m not poor, and i make good money, but i lost all but $1k of my life savings the last 2 years which hasn’t helped. at this point, the only other medication routes i can take are alcohol, kratom, and sugar. obviously none of these are healthy but they’re the only things left. you know how people say a lot of alcoholics see the drink as a friend? on paper, it’s a better friend than most people i’ve met. but i haven’t drank in a while in an effort to improve my mental health. i nearly blocked my landlord and bought a plane ticket to europe last night, figuring i’d leave my material things behind and move somewhere warmer and try to start fresh. it was too late for a covid test and my airfrance account was locked so i couldn’t. i’m still tempted today but there’s too much logistical stuff to sort out. went to one friends last night for a bit, decorated his tree and played some video games. he was worried about me walking home even, given that nyc is a frozen crime spree the past year or two. i’m not much for video games, but even if i wanted to play some at home (i like playing fs2020), i can’t because computer issues. have to wait on a part to ship. just seems like the universe keeps taking from me even though i’m not doing anything stupid to ask for it.",1.0,0.0,Depression,and winter have take hold last few day I have felt that slump into a deep winter depression and far worse than past year i do not know if i can make it through one more its extra tough because winter always turn me into a miserable person who end up lose friend and previous accomplishment i do not even know how many sub here i be ban from last winter its embarrassing i still get dms from people tell me off which just worsen thing I have consistently lose a girlfriend every one of the last few winter last winter lead to me lose my entire friend group namely because one guy throw me to the street when i need help most and then return my ativan script to me which i ask him to hold for me so i would not touch it naturally everything spiral and i spend most of this year friendless and lock up inside i work from home and the pandemic have make my neighborhood in nyc far too dangerous siren every 510 min no joke and citizen show half a dozen or more nearby shooting every night i try super hard when i fall off track to get back into my career my fitness routine a healthy diet and not forget my med I be on nardil you know the last resort when even ect will not work and now t3cytomel as well and its still not enough I have spend the last few day in bed sobbing and shiver from the cold half the tenant move out so i think the landlord cut the heat a bit this year my friend and neighbor next door just move out and i have 3 friend leave here who i do not get to see much this be not a suicide call for help but i do not see the point in life when the ratio of good to bad be so poor i have an amazing 2020 despite most and I be so grateful for that 2021 have be a horrible year load with deaths people leave me sickness health problem weight gain and a general lack of activity at one point i calculate an average of 3 week between bad thing happen give my strong feeling that more bad thing be come its either go to be my girlfriend or job i lose next she be absolutely wonderful and very supportive and i coown a business but I be sure both will drop out on me as well just like everything else my doctor and therapist have be concern but i can not get into a ketamine study or afford to go to a clinic for it I be not poor and i make good money but i lose all but 1k of my life save the last 2 year which have not help at this point the only other medication route i can take be alcohol kratom and sugar obviously none of these be healthy but they be the only thing leave you know how people say a lot of alcoholic see the drink as a friend on paper its a better friend than most people I have meet but i have not drink in a while in an effort to improve my mental health i nearly block my landlord and buy a plane ticket to europe last night figure id leave my material thing behind and move somewhere warmer and try to start fresh it be too late for a covid test and my airfrance account be lock so i could not I be still tempt today but there be too much logistical stuff to sort out go to one friend last night for a bit decorate his tree and play some video game he be worry about me walk home even give that nyc be a frozen crime spree the past year or two I be not much for video game but even if i want to play some at home i like play fs2020 i can not because computer issue have to wait on a part to ship just seem like the universe keep take from me even though I be not do anything stupid to ask for it,0
