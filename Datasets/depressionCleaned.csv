"i just told my partner to leave me again, he may actually do it this time, and i want to die",Queen-Keane,"we’ve only been officially together 5 months, but we’ve been talking nearly a year. i always think that i am doing okay but then my low self esteem and mental health issues kick in and i see what a mess i truly am.i love my partner, and i want our relationship to work. but i am convinced that i am absolute shit and that he deserves better. i am convinced that i cannot be the healthy partner he deserves; that i cannot provide him with the happy healthy fulfilling relationship he deserves. i breakdown too much, i talk about myself negatively too much, i do not work a job that allows me to live independently, i do not have much money saved at all, i am awkward, i am anxious, i am ugly, i am selfish, i am a coward, i am just a bad person. i want to be with him, but i also feel obligated to “set him free” so that he can do better. but i do that by constantly telling him the above and asking him to leave me - rather than actually leaving him because i don’t actually want us to break up. but i told him to leave me again tonight. i told him that i would never stop telling him to leave me because i need to protect him and because he deserves better and i am shit. he told me he is devastated. that i am being unbelievably cruel. that i am not freeing him but rather that i am causing him to question if i ever want to be better and causing him to lose his faith in looking for the good in people ever. he told me i don’t want this relationship. he told me not to contact him for a few days while he struggles with all of this.i hate myself. for hurting him. for pushing and pulling him. for being who i am. for maybe finally truly losing him. and i just want to curl into a ball and die. he has every right to leave and he should leave. i just hope he doesn’t. but i don’t know. i ruined things. i completely ruined them. and if by some miracle he doesn’t leave this time, i know he’ll have lost his faith in me and some love for me. and i know i will ruin things again. i want to throw up. i just want to be happy and healthy and to be able to be the the partner he deserves. but i am irredeemably broken. he deserves better. and i can’t believe i hurt him so much. and i hate myself for it. and i want to die.

i don’t remember these last 2 years?,SiberianMidas,"i (22/f) feel like i was depressed in 2019 and 2020, but this year my depression has been getting worse and now i consider it pretty severe. and i just realized that i barely remember anything these last 2 years, especially 2020. 2020 and early 2021 was a total brain fog and it feels like i jumped forward in time or something. it feels like it didn’t happen and like that year went by in a couple of days. even though my depression is the worst it’s ever been right now i feel like i’m aware for the first time in 2 years. it’s as though i lost 2 years of my life. however i still feel like life is a dream and like it isn’t real, it’s hard to explain but every time i’m in public i just feel as though i’m walking in a dream and my mind feels really foggy. i feel pretty emotionally numb as well, like i’m dead inside most days. my mind is super active, i feel like my thoughts are racing often and it sometimes makes me feel physically nauseous. i can’t think about my past or my life, i have to constantly distract myself not to. i’ve been struggling with my mental health since i was 12 but i’ve never felt this mentally ill in my life. i feel like something is wrong with me. i’m trying to find a job in another city and move out of my parents house to start a new life, but i don’t have any motivation to do anything anymore. i have really bad social anxiety that i’ve had since i was 12 so it makes it a lot harder for me to move out. i’m just on autopilot and i’m really tired. i don’t feel happy or very sad, most of the time i just feel numb and exhausted. sometimes i get really bad anxiety and i have to talk myself into calming down. and sometimes i feel intense emotional pain that’s really hard to deal with, and i can’t even cry. i started therapy last week but i don’t think it will help me, it never has before. i’m not suicidal in the sense that i would never do it because of my family, but if i didn’t have them i would probably have kms already.",8.0,2.0,1574775192.0,depression

lack of drive to do anything,Sad_Tale7758,"i've been struggling with doing anything that ""makes me proud"", as others would call it, like ever. i pretty much fail with anything substantial i do and i don't feel bad about failing, i actually prefer to fail on tests because then that means i don't have to study anymore; the culture i live in tends to accept being weak (sweden), so it doesn't set me back - i always have the option to get back to studying after dropping out, so there's no loss aside from the time lost, which is going to be spent one way or another.anything i do feels like pulling teeth and i'd rather listen to music all day & watch netflix. i'm somewhat content with the idea of not doing anything with my life, which worries me in a way because i imagine 40 years from now if i'm ""wasting my 20's"". i think i have a hard time valuing my future self, and i'm likely very ignorant about the whole thing. i don't care about status, money, respect, influence, impact. legacy or anything that drives other people to their endavors. the only thing that somewhat drives my brain is thinking about a new idea.&#x200b;i have managed to get some minor things done (out of pure force and near 0 motivation) before such as launching websites that did pretty well, but they just cause me a lot of anxiety having to maintain them, especially when they become successful - not to mention the potential critics i have to face for no apparent reason other than opposed opinion. i'd rather just not deal with that.&#x200b;i tend to avoid taking responsibility whenever possible. i don't care if people think low of me, even my family. i have a lot of interesting ideas in my head that i want to do, but they remain ideas and the only joy i get is thinking about ideas instead of executing on them. i'm wondering if there's something i should do about this or if i should just accept ""who i am"".&#x200b;i think one factor is that i grew up in a decent household. i never really had to work for anything, and i can stay at home as long as i like. i'm not getting pressured to do anything, and failing doesn't really punish my lifestyle in any way or form. growing up like this made me pretty insecure about being uncomfortable, and being uncomfortable for too long gives me more stress than anything: everything new feels daunting and gives me anxiety, with no light at the end of the tunnel so to speak.&#x200b;tldr; i'm not very stress tolerant, i don't have any internal motivation, i don't take a lot of responsibility which people like jordan petersson keeps telling me i should do, but i always try to avoid it. i'm pretty selfish in life, i don't try to help others unless i'm faced with social pressure. i prefer to stay ignorant about the world around me because the realization of the world burning just gives me more anxiety.  i also get more joy out of watching yugioh than i get molding my legacy in this world. why???   **edit**: if i could take a pill that would make me a functioning human in society i would probably take it. by functioning i mean having something i'm passionate about with a bigger goal that i'm working towards. i feel like i'm missing out seeing others do this, but when i do something myself - it doesn't fill the void i feel.",2.0,0.0,1601565836.0,depression

is it normal to feel depressed after every argument?,Throwmeawayletmestay,"i have struggled with clinical depression for many years. after any argument i have, no matter how minor & whether it be with parents, friends, or so, i fall into a depressive hole. basically until it gets resolved and/or until i get over it. for example lately whenever my so and i argue & can’t come to a resolution i cry nonstop and get depressed until we figure it out. it triggers other parts of my depression & makes me self shame or self hate. this can last for hours or days on end depending on whether we figure it out or both decide to sulk and neither apologizes.is this normal? i feel so horrible for putting my so through this. he gets super down too usually to see me so depressed & he struggles with some form of depression too. i hate it, i wish i wasn’t like this and wish i could control it better. i don’t want to put anyone else through this just because i have depression. i don’t know what to do anymore. it seems more like a me problem than anything. any words of comfort or advice are much appreciated.",16.0,2.0,1638758273.0,depression

depressed and lonely - please help,VeechuRoti,"hi, just for some background i am 19f and am in my first term of university. i have never really had friends before this. in primary school, people did not like me. i had friends but obviously children end up slipping and i realised that sometimes i was the butt of the joke.  in secondary school. i became less shy and tried talking to people more but then one day when talking to a classmate, i realised my classmates found me annoying (which there were signs for). i became really quiet after that and withdrew because i realised people were just acting nice to my face but then talking about me behind my back. i started talking to a girl in one of my lessons and after a while, she literally wrote an article about how i was talkative and annoying mentioning my name and publishing it on the internet. she changed it after i shared this out of frustration to the few people i actually somewhat spoke too and they agreed that it was rude. i think they took matters into their own hands and wrote some messages on the group chat talking about how rude doing it was to do something like this (but not specifically to or about her) which prompted her to change it. in the sixth form, i hung out with more people but all they really did was laugh at me (even if nothing really had happened). i talked to people in lessons but nobody really cared about me. i thought i has a friend when some guy invited me to sit with him when my usually lab partner was not in, talked to me a lot and texted me but then he just did not acknowledge me for three months. throughout this, i thought i had one friend but i think it is becoming more and more clear i am just something for her to dump her stories to or rant to. i remember she sent me screenshots of her talking to a guy and they mocked me telling me my wedding cake would have maths equations on it.somehow, i got into a competitive university even though most people thought i would not be the type of person to get in. i try to talk to people but find it hard to connect with other people and their interests. i either get blamed even if it was their fault or talked at. also, the same person likes to highlight how small she is and how she gets a lot of male attention but also calls herself 'fat' which i find triggering since right before university i was restricting a lot and as a result of eating more have gained 20kg. she is also quite bossy and after i highlighted i did not like being treated this way she said it was me so now i don't know who's at fault. i feel really stupid at my university and it is not imposter syndrome because i do not doubt my abilities - i just feel like i have lost the will to try hard. the same girl tells me i look like i have no idea what's happening even though she talks over other people and is wrong a lot as well. i literally have two friends. one is from my old school who invites me to places but going there always reminds me of how alone i am and how i can never relate to people.i know people tell you to go out and meet new people which is what i have tried. i have gone to societies and talked to people and when i feel the worst has decided to reconnect with old friends or people i have talked to. however, even though i can talk to people, nobody ever wants to hang out or be friends. the other friend likes to hang out twice but it is usually with other people and i feel like the third wheel a lot.most nights at university i cry myself to sleep. i have contemplated suicide a little but know it will hurt my parents too much and that i have come so far that having few friends seems like a not good enough reason. however, i am finding it hard to cope. i have always felt unattractive and have rarely got compliments and i know i am definitely unattractive. the only people who have remotely appeared interested in me were creepy, lonely tutors when i was 16. people my age probably think i am overweight and ugly. i remember once a girl in my class saw a photo of me saying i was cute and then was like to the guy who i mentioned earlier 'isn't she cute' and he just remained silent. i know i can lose weight and lost 25kg last year however i nearly and probably already had slipped into an eating disorder.i just feel so empty and sometimes i feel so much pain that i can feel it in my chest. i feel like it is me - maybe i'm rude, bossy and inconsiderate but i try to be nice and then afterwards treat others the same way they treat me. my flatmates seem annoyed i implied they were loud at midnight but i had not complained of so long and they were shouting in the kitchen. i thought i was making friends with another flatmate but then she would completely ignore me when other flatmates were in the room which after a month prompted me to withdraw from her. this could be low self-esteem but i think it is more like frustration that people might think i am unreasonable e.g. implying flatmates are loud even though in a flat it would be nice to be considerate of everyone and they can party and make noise in the kitchen preferably not full-on continuously shout and scream at the top of their lungs. i don't even know who i am anymore -

i finally understand why and it scares me.,Longjumping_Run8096,"i am super depressed and did a burst of crying and wished for something in the cosmos to just burn my soul to oblivion. i am hoping typing this out helps me through this. i never really do this. ill try to do a summery at the top if this gets too long. emotions are difficult.  the following event has full baring on how i currently feel emotionally. to start off my uncle was my mothers brother, both were abused by a very sinister step father growing up. he also probably suffered ptsd when in the army during desert storm 91(bush sr. war). my mother, grandmother and him were very close. he was in his early 30's or late 20'swhen i was around 10 years old. my uncle committed suicide. he was in the beginning process of my aunt divorcing him. why she wanted to leave i don't have the answer nor do i desire to know. my grandmother and mom was aware of what was going on and was supporting him the best they could being 4-5 hours away with the communication technology of the mid 90's. we lived in a neighboring state from him and it required long distance or collect calls. a long distance call once a week or a few times a month i am sure happened.  they did not however, have the finances to just pick up the phone and call every day to check up on him. i know my grandmother offered to find a new place to live and for him to move in with her and give him what ever he needed. unfortunately, the one thing he needed was not in her power to give. he knew this and i assumed my grandmother also new this, but tried anyway.my uncle apparently loved to hunt. it was not odd for him to go hunting by himself once in a while and return a few days later. this probably helped him with any ptsd. he always let people know the general area and how long he would be gone for. he ended up being missing for more than week or close to a week. again no cell phones, so you cant call a person and check on them and have others try to ultimately put in a missing person request the same day or next daythey put a missing person request to the police and began searching for him. they believe he  probably wanted to be found after commuting suicide. it did not take long to find him when the search began. they had to go in a dens forested area up in the mountains to find him. he was around the area that he told people.i can remember this day and the days to come. some parts are more clear than the others. my mother worked as a director for a daycare(s). i usually when to a separate daycare, but for some reason i was at the one she worked at. that day is a blur but i remember two police officers went to the daycare center to let her know a forest ranger found the body. he shot him self in the head. what ever hope she had left her. she broke down and was long time before she was calm enough to go home. she was not expecting that answer.  i do not remember how long until she broke the news to my grandmother. i know she wanted to do it the best way possible. at that time they found a church they liked and had been going to it for less than a year. my mother and grandmother also participated in a weekly small group bible study. to brake the unfortunate truth my mother went to the senior living apartment my grandmother was living in. for support my mother brought along the small group bible study leader and his wife, an elder/the pastor from the church, my mothers long time friend from high school, me and my older sister. in that apartment complex you had to push a button that rang the phone in the owners room. they would push a number and the door would unlock. the activity room the complex had was across the main entrance when you entered. my grandmother was in there and saw my mom and went to let her in. as soon as she put her and on the door to open, she saw everyone else that need to be let in. she did not open the door and refused as she started to cry. i remember her telling every one to go away, nothing bad happened to her son. she stood there and cried for a long time. one of her friends from that activity room had to come over open the door to let us in. we went in and up to her room to give the news. i don't remember much after that. all was a blur up to the funeral. i remember not understanding or crying before  any of this or during memorial service. they had two caskets. one that was open with his military picture, and empty military uniform with no body in the foyer. the one with his actual body was in the church service area. i remember there was a handful of speeches and a few songs they played. men in uniform took the casket and loaded it for transport. i remember a lot of people showed up. they had seating outside. my mom, grandma, and my aunt were sitting up front. a man in uniform  presented two folded up american flag to each my grandmother and aunt while they wept. then the gun salute went off, a man with bugle played taps and the casket was lowered in the ground. everyone cried. i cried, but did not understand why. my uncle decided to blow his brains out because he was afraid my aunt would take way their three kids from them. as i got older i never understood why he did that and not just see the kids/my cousins when he could from time to time. even as and adult and having kids my self never understood the decision.   right now in this moment i probably understand what he was going in his mind and what he was feeling. i am sure it was not a quick pull of the trigger. i am sure he cried multiple times and may not have gone to actually go through with it. the thought of loosing his kids or only being allowed to see them a few times a week broke him. that constant thought and no viable solution to keep his kids made pulling the trigger easer.to be clear. after all was said and done. my mom, grandma, aunt and her family have been on very good terms. we still went to visit for thanksgiving and other holidays every year as i grew up. my sister and i also would still visit 2 weeks or a month for summer before the 4th of july. my aunt remarried a very good man with his own kids on shared custody. we had bigger family gatherings and very good memories. i unfortunately am driven in a situation where i can not physically see my two kids every day. i have cried multiple times wanting to hold my kids and see them everyday. i have the option of being hired with a large well known tech company and be able to afford a descent living and still enjoy what i do, but i cant see my kids every day. my wife refuses to move 4hours way from her parent and family in that small town. i currently make $26 with what i do right now. she and the kids live with her mom currently while i try to rent apartment or house.  i have for the past year applied for at least what felt like a few hundred jobs in and around her small town. two things happen. 95% they don't call for an interview. if they do they don't pay enough. we were struggling when i was making 18/hr and rent was 650/month. to get a place now its almost 1000/month for less then what we had in the same area. i was being offered $12-$14/hr with 10 years of experience in it. i feel trapped in a situation i cant win. i get a good paying job but my wife refuses to move in the city i currently work making 26/hr. i am unable to see my kids everyday.if i want to see my kids on a daily basis i have to take a job with a deep pay cut and not make enough to rent our own place. we would have to move in with her mom and dad forever. i cant see how that should be a choice. it should be for emergency.i cant take the kids from her. she is a very good mother to them. i cant just leave them either and move on like its nothing.  i finely understand why my uncle did what he did. it scares me. the last option is to just end it and be done at this point.",5.0,0.0,1638743827.0,depression

i’m never happy,saturnAstarship,"i got diagnosed with depression about  a year ago. got on sertraline, thought it didn’t help, came off just now (2 weeks ago) and wow, never been so low. even when i was on sertraline. life was just.. mediocre. for the life of me i can’t see why people enjoy this time on earth. my life, from an outside perspective, is alright. i’m a student, financially independent, alright health (well, i’ve got tinnitus, but the depression stems underneath that, defo a factor tho) good family etc then why am i so.. not sad but empty? i sit and think what is the point. i have a purpose, which is to be a doctor. but i can’t explain how i feel. when my friends are enjoying themselves, i sit back and just think how, how are you doing that? i absolutely despise being alone.. so i got a boyfriend (haha, obvs that didn’t end well) but it’s not even the breakup that’s the issue,i don’t care about that. i dont know. i’m just empty, even with meds, i’m empty.. but functional. i try fillmy days with activities. but before i even get to them i just think what’s the point? the only thing i can say i love is reading. but then i get sad after i finish because that temporary moment of happiness i get living in a fictional world is gone. plus my ocd makes it difficult to read at times (i have a compulsion where i must read certain words back words) i should try therapy, i’ve done cbt cycles myself and journaling. it didn’t help tho. i don’t know what the point of this post was.. i guess i’m asking, how do u do things without feeling empty and just not here?",1.0,1.0,1619815071.0,depression

"feeling extremely down, don't really have the time for that",LupinMD,"hello, i've been a long time lurker of this sub. i have suffered from depression since my adolescence years. had psicotherapy for a long time, and had a momento in my life (last year of my career) which i took antidepressants. i am currently 28 years old, i have been a physician for 3 years now. i feel kind of underwhelmed for what i have achieved, i had excellent grades in college, i finished in the top 10 of all students of my year (we were more than 300), and i have always have ingrained in my brain that i was ""destined for greatness"". well, i was doing my residency to become a pediatrician (perhaps in part as guilt due to my significant other comitting an abortion without telling me anything), it didn't make me happy, and i resigned 6 months into the program. where i live, when you resign to a residency program, you have to wait 2 years unless you justify it, i tried to do that, and then the pandemic appeared and ruined all of my plans as well as the rest of the worlds. couldn't even work as i needed to finish my resignation, and it was stagnated because everything was closed. i began working againt on july 2020, up until about now, i tried to give the exam needed to do the residency program, and unfortunately i couldn't enter this year. not doing well enough in the exam this year broke the confidence or false confidence i always had in myself. things just seem to always go well for me regardless of the amount of effort i put into it (i didn't do enough this time around i must admit). now, i am having a mid life crisis, i am supposed to be studying since now for the exam next year in june, but i haven't studied seriously since october of this year my work is from 8am to 2pm, but when i arrive home i feel as if i had worked 24 hours, and as if i needed a vacation every weekend. i have resumed psicotherapy since around 1 month ago, and i am considering taking antidepressants again.  there are many things that are in my head, many people in my country go abroad to study residency programs, but it is costly, demands a lot of time, and has a lot of bureaucreacy , i know i am young but i think that if i can't even study in my country, how will i do that anywhere else. i have a dream of living somehwere else maybe for a few years, just to see the cultural differences and how it is in another country, i fear i will not achieve it if i just finish my training here, because if i go anywhere else they mostly make you work two years as a general practioner until they recognize your title. i am currently on a long distance relationship, and it takes a huge toll on me too, my partner also is suffering from depression and currently taking medication, and sometimes she gets frustrated so i can't tell her everything. i have decided to just study here and later go somewhere else is the oportunity arise, but i just can't concéntrate, i feel tired all the time, everything looks dark, i am bored of the routine. thanks for reading, and i wish well for everyone here, i came here for comfort when i felt i didn't have anyone else throughout the years.",1.0,0.0,1451154524.0,depression

i feel extremely emotionally detached,JimmyRedditz1,"i'm a 34 year old man, and i've dealt with depression and anxiety for basically my entire life. it's manifested itself in fits of rage, anxiety attacks, panic attacks, overwhelming sadness, and long bouts of inaction and laziness. i have a hard time maintaining and creating friendships, and while i can chalk some of that up to my own natural introversion and my long-term friends being busy with careers and kids now. but it has become a huge problem that's really getting me down lately.background info: at the end of 2020, i moved to california. honestly, the move was originally to try and kindle a flame in a long-distance relationship, but even after that didn't work out, i was in good spirits. i was proud of myself for making a big decision, doing it myself, driving across the country alone. i loved the weather and lifestyle of the area. my anxiety and depression were generally more at bay than they have ever been.but, once things weren't going to work out with this person, i knew i had to go. i tried finding affordable places to live in the area, but even roommate situations were just priced out of control. i moved back home, all the way back to the other side of the country. at first, i was extremely sad and bitterly disappointed. i quickly put things into perspective by understanding that the important thing was taking the chance and really making a change in my life, even if it didn't work out. i don't regret it. this lifted me for a while, and i was re-connecting with a couple old friends and family. i even started making a couple new friends through my old friends.but lately, i've seemingly lost the ability to have emotional connections with anyone. everything feels disturbingly surface level. the woman i moved across the country for and i had a very deep connection. we talked about philosophies, politics, our feelings and emotions, our pasts; we would always talk about really deep things. here, it feels like i can't get on that level with anyone. i'm afraid to talk about my real feelings with anyone. i don't want anyone to know i'm hurting. i become very disappointed in people, and instead of talking about it, i keep them at arm's length. i'm having a hard time trusting anyone. on my worst days, i feel really alone in the world. i have put these walls up and i'm unsure how to allow them to be broken down.i'm not sure what i'm looking for. advice or something else. it helps me to write it out, either way.tl;dr having an impossible time connecting with anyone, very sad about it",4.0,3.0,1634219217.0,depression

(do not have anyone, especially hurts because i don't have a ""squad"" of friends)* i feel i will never find love or get anyone in my life who truly cares for me since i am never going to be good enough for anyone. be it a friend or a relationship (everytime i try to get close to someone they push me away, i have been told i am too pushy or come off too strong)* i feel like i am missing out on the biggest experiences of my life because i do not have people around (never been to a concert, properly clubbing, )these thoughts/feelings almost always come and go but they often come at the worst times (public transport, restaurants etc), suddenly i feel a shortness of breath and panic starts to kick in. as soon as i settle down however, it gets worse, i get into this deep train of thoughts and before you know it, i get disgusting suicidal thoughts even though i definetly do not want to kill myself but i have almost started to hate myself to a crippling point. people have called me i am personality-less and that my energy does not vibe with anyone. i am never invited to any outings and people just think i am uncool and don't have a life. i used to be able to hold conversations very easily but just cannot hold them any longer. i used to love singing but now i hate my voice and i purposefully ruined it by not taking care of my health (alcoholism and oily food). had great friends but most either no longer reply to messages or straight-up act like its normal. the people i want to build connections with and tell them i love/care for them and want to talk to them (even if as just friends) push me away/ignore me. almost everything i do to change my situation, i return back to square one... a lonely loser fucker who is better off not being in anyone's business. i tried joining the music soc, the art society, used apps like meet-up and joined toastmasters... all in the hopes to keep me busy and meet new people... instead its made things worse for me from a mental point of view... yeah i did enjoy all of it but never fullfilled my purpose of finding friendship or a ""group of friends"" to get rid of loneliness. in desperation, i tagged along with my flatmates friends and well they do not treat me right and are a bunch of assholes. &#x200b;i feel like crying but my chest feels so choked that not even a tear can come off me. i have no one to talk to about this, therapy is a joke..all they tell me are stupid breathing exercises which make me hyperventilate, flatmate.. already spoke to him and he is of no use. mom and dad, rather hit myself on the head&#x200b;i am going to graduate soon and have no idea what i want to do life, i am also doing a solo-trip for the first time ever in 4 days and while i am optimistic about it, i am freakishly scared. i am incredibly lost and all i want is someone to appreciate me for who i am because being reminded of me being personality-less (told by an asshole person) hurts a lot and it physically aches me every time i think of it.&#x200b;**tldr: a lonely fucker who's a virgin, supposedly personality-less, trying his best to make friendships but failing spectacularly and have an apperance related issues which nukes down my confidence to zero. do not think i will ever be able to fix myself and get extreme suicdal thoughts even though i do not think i am suicidal. all i want is a group of friends/squad of people who appreciate me for who i am and want a direction in my life in terms of career, academics, love, friendships and more.**",6.0,1.0,1472536157.0,depression

struggling a lot recently,bsqd001,"i am a 25 year old male, i've had horrible depression my whole life. currently i live with my parents and i just got a job working in it. i don't take any anti-depressants cause i've had horrible results with all the ones i've tried, so i do my best to keep it under control by exercising, playing music, and trying to socialize with people (atm i have no friends). smoking weed helps as well. usually i can fake being happy, but inevitably i always break down because i get tired of faking it. all i want in life is peace within myself, but as more years go by i fear that i will never find it, and that really bums me out. because how can i create a life i want if i can't even be happy on my own? i've tried so many different methods to get this shit under control from therapy, anti-depressants, support groups, meditation, yoga etc. it seems no matter what i do, in the end i feel hopeless, worthless, and discontent. i hate crying myself to sleep every night because i feel completely alone, i hate trying to fake my happiness so my family doesn't worry about me, i hate the fact that i can't make enough money to afford my own place, i hate how i can never make a relationship work because of my problems, i hate how other peoples lives seem fulfilling and joyful while i always seem to be suffering. i try to make friends and meet people but ultimately i choose to be alone anyway because it's easier. i always have compulsive, really negative thoughts about myself that cause me to break down, and i don't want to be around people when i can barely keep it together.i'm so tired of going through feeling this way day after day, year after year. it's so exhausting, and it only gets harder to have any hope for myself as more years go by. nobody seems to care how i feel, no one asks how i'm doing, it just feels like i am a worthless human being that nobody wants anything to do with. i have nothing to look forward to, and no one to even try and enjoy life with. i can't recall the last time i was excited about anything. my spirit feels crushed, and i feel that this life is only pain with only glimpses of joy here and there. i wish i had a different perspective, but my reality tells me otherwise. regardless, i will keep trying, for the sake of the people that do care about me i'll keep doing the best i can to get through this.",2.0,1.0,1561578697.0,depression

i think there's something wrong with me....,starnove,"hello reddit! i created this account because i wanted to get this out of my system. i'm your average bratty teen who's currently undergoing her daily dose of ""i have no idea what the fuck is going on"". right now, i have no idea what i'm feeling. am i being dramatic? spoiled maybe? i feel like i've been showered with love but it seems lacking. i feel disconnected from my family. i feel as if i am being shut down or unheard. i have mood swings. i'm irritable. i feel as if i cannot reach out to anyone because it's been drilled into my mind that no one gives a shit. i can't even take it upon myself to give a shit about other people, so why should they? i'm a horrible person. but i still blame others. crazy right? i don't have any goals in life. i'm just living for the sake of living. everyday i just do the same things. nothing new. nothing to look forward to. the small things i used to hang on to which gave meaning to my life are slowly fading away. but i have no courage to do any physical harm to myself. i feel like i don't have the right to vent or rant or think that i have a problem if i don't go to the extremes. i don't know what to do. i'm lost. am i the one in the wrong for thinking this way? i feel like i'm just creating more problems for myself. i feel like everything's been given to me but i still have a way of finding the bad in it. i'm mad. mad at myself. mad at everyone who has made me feel this way. i feel like a spoiled brat for thinking that i should be heard. i feel spoiled to think that my feelings should be valid -- to think that i am worthy of asking for more. i feel bad for the people that would read this, as if i'm just creating more problems for others. i feel bad for all of you who have been inconvenienced with my feelings that i have written on this post. i feel sorry for wanting to be heard. so many feelings are stirring within me but i feel too guilty to call it a problem. but at the same time, i want to be labelled with some form of illness just to be heard.

help,Sea_Ad7042,"hi guys, i hope you soon come to terms with your insecurities. i am a 21 year old with a receding hairline and thinning hair. it really, really fucking bothers me. ever since i was in elementary school noticing my dad go bald , i always worried for him. i didn’t want him to go bald because he looked better with hair. i also was embarrassed of him, especially around females. i worried that females would see my balding father, assume that i would go bald at some point, and judge me for it. i worried that having a bald father would prevent me from finding love. that sounds so dumb but i actually worried about that when i was younger… a lot. i even bought him rogain for christmas but he never used it 🤣. he didn’t like that he was balding but it didn’t seem to bother him too too much. he has way more to him than his hair. in high school i grew my hair out super long for the first time and really really loved it. i loved putting my hair up, doing braids, etc. my favorite thing about myself was my locks, not sure why. it’s how i expressed myself and i felt so confident in my appearance and my looks. i think i liked how i looked a little bit too much.  at one point in high school i pulled my hair back and thought “damn i kinda have a gigantic forehead” but i didn’t think about it too much. there was this one picture in hs of me with my hair in ponytail where my forehead is showing and my friends noticed and made fun of met. it still did not bother me because i didn’t really foresee that my big forehead = balding. idk, i’ve always had a big forehead so i didn’t think too much into it. i got a haircut before my freshman year of college and didn’t like it very much. i just like having luscious locks, damnit. anyways, freshman year of college class i started getting really bad acne. like really fuckin bad. i had some in hs but not to this level. i’m talkin huge, cystic, horrible stuff. it was my first time being insecure and it hit me pretty hard. my acne combined with my short hair; i just wasn’t as sexy as i used to be. i struggled to make friends my freshman year for the first time. i ended up going on accutane. it really helped but it made my face flake and took so long before it started working. the only thing worse than having really bad acne is being on accutane and still having bad acne. it was shitty to be on accutane but after it was over, my face was clear and i was free of that insecurity finally. man, i was pretty happy for the summer after freshman year. i got a job as a lifeguard, was super tan, attractive, a good body. i made new friends that i loved. i was happy to be out of my relationship. welp, all good things come to an end. on a road trip to pittsburgh, a fellow balding friend pointed out that i “wasn’t far behind him” in terms of hair loss. at first i was like wtf but then i realized he was totally right. we had been camping and wearing hats for days so i was hoping that once i had a shower i would realize that i was just geeking myself out. but nope, it was true. i was totally loosing my hair. how could i have missed this in the past few years. like, it was almost noticeable at this point, so i was shocked that i hadn’t been aware of this until now. when i got back from the trip, i stayed up night after night reading about treatment and just feeling really anxious and depressed about it. i felt like my life was over. literally. (i deadass still feel this way) i ordered finesteride like 3 days after getting home but never ended up using it. i didn’t want to commit to it. and it’s expensive as fuck. anyways, i went back to college and went on with my hopeless life. so much of my mood/happiness had went hand and hand with my appearance. so i felt like my well being will continue to follow in the footsteps of my thinning hair. i started drinking a lot that year. (which was my sophomore year in college) not sure if it was related to my hair loss but it became an issue. i was getting drunk every day like all day. i managed to pass my classes because they were still the easy ones. i stopped drinking so much before the end of the semester. i still cared so much about my hair loss. i thought that my mental health would rebound after the hair loss shock was over but it didn’t. i wasn’t shocked about it but i fucking geeked out about it all day. i was always looking at other dudes and comparing myself. i was always worried that no girl was gonna marry me cause i’ll be bald as shit by then. the worst part about the experience is the feeling of hopelessness. the feeling that your life can only get worse. i, to this day, have not overcome that. the future never excited me once i became aware of my bad genes. the future haunts me. part of a joyful and happy life is thinking about the future with hope and excitement. all of that was lost when i learned about my hair loss. from now on, i’m just going through the motions of life, hoping somebody will hand me 20,000 dollars for a hair transplant. or that a magic genie will give me a bunch of hair again. or that i will stop being a pussy about it and not care. who the fuck even cares? ever since i learned about my hair loss , my feelings of hopelessness have been the same. additionally, i’ve been through some breakups that have been rough.the worst thing is this: nobody knows about my hair loss except for the one friend who pointed it out years ago. either that, or they don’t say anything. my thin hair is a secret and i’m always monitoring everyone around me so they cannot see it. i’m always in this weird defensive cover-up mode. i feel so fucking vulnerable all the time even around my fuckin parents. i always think about the day they’re gonna notice. i bottle up all my feelings and have no way to let them out.i have this weird thing where i care too much about my looks. balding is hitting me hard because of how much i value my beautiful hair. the only time i am excited for the future is when i imagine myself when i’m like 45 and older, where i’m already bald and over it.  today i have long hair. it still looks pretty good and luscious when i wash it and brush it. i hate that soon i will be stripped of the very feature that i value the most. i fear that i will be stripped of my happiness in the process. i know i have so much potential and i’m noticing that my hair loss is changing me. i’m affected by this in an extremely unhealthy way. im hiding all the time. im so sad about this. i need your help. i need some encouragement or advice. writing this has got me feeling really, really down. it’s got me thinking about the future and it feels bad. i feel fucked. i often think about death. things like, “i wouldn’t mind dying today, at least i’d be out of this.” i’ve always loved hair! to this day i still braid girls hair and just love it. my favorite thing is falling out so it’s especially a big deal for me .i feel like balding has stopped me from progressing as a human being. i want to be happy for people for their achievements. i often look at others and are comforted by their hair loss, especially then it’s worse than mine. these are evil, evil thoughts. i want to wish the best for other people. i need to find a source of happiness and joy that comes externally. again, my happiness and appearance seems to come hand in hand. i need to beat this or i won’t be here for much longer. i cannot take the feelings that i’m having squandering my life away. i don’t want to spend another night on my god damn phone looking shit up about balding on google. i kind of wish my hair loss would just get super bad so i could embrace it and move the fuck on. i mean seriously, can i worry about something that matters? can i focus on something larger than myself? one last thing, i don’t think bald looks good. i mean let’s be honest, it doesn’t. it’s like the worst haircut. i remember being in church when i was little before i knew that men’s hair falls out saying “dad, why do all these men shave their hair on top and keep the sides?” i need to beat this. the psychological effects of balding a legitimate i tell you. it’s nonstop, it’s relentless, it’s brutal, it’s fucking intense. i feel so sad about this, i cannot see myself identifying with being bald.  have any tips? my goal is to not give a shit about my looks and shift that energy to being better to those around me. people still aren’t noticing my hair loss. i don’t want to shave my head at this point. i want to be able to accept my reality and come to terms with it. if u read this whole thing, u are a trooper. i could barely write it. thank u. i hope u beat your demons. you have so much potential just get out of ur head!!!!! mfpls help, i can’t keep hiding forever. i wanna get over myself for fuck’s sake.",1.0,1.0,1601842103.0,depression

creative writing to think,EbbyG,"a therapist once told me that writing short stories with characters helps you understand your emotions. is this depression?:   he laid in bed. hard thoughts knocked down every good urge to wake up and do something. the face of a beautiful girl shined like the moon on a crisp winter night. the moon turned red when he opened his eyes to see the room so bleak. “how did it get to this?”, he asked himself. give me love, give me peace, torment me no longer with thoughts of what could have been. lie to me not about what it still can be. the moon is red with my own blood, i’ve broken my fate and fell into my own abyss. i’d die to escape, if i believed that death was an escape. the walls are growing smaller with every breath. where is god now? a tear came to his eye. like from a fountain of youth, the stress in his face eased, replaced with a plea. “my god, restore my mind to be like the comfort in the sun. give my hands over to purpose, a life lived to diminish this pain. i see no other path, all others have led to pain and hardship. i can’t go on like this.” the tear dried up before it could crash. he lied motionless in bed. with the tear gone, like the rain clouds evaporated by the heat, the sands of the desert came to rule. rustling over hills of itself, sliding down steep drops, turning with the gusts of the wind, a terror drew in from the deep. a terror saying “this is your eternity. no one to love, no life to give. none to have.” to get out of the sand, he sat up and got out of bed to get his day started. “there is still time. i can make it to a land of rolling hills.”",2.0,0.0,1548536854.0,depression

feeling trapped/help!,eri8693,"ranting/advice help!so not by my choice my husband and his dad wanted to buy this place together for us all to live (5 acres). the house has a master bedroom upstairs and small office (which we’re using for two of our girls currently and our son is sleeping in a crib on our room). there is two bedrooms downstairs that they get and is “theirs” (his sister is living in one room (the bigger room) who is “suppose” to move to utah in 1-2 years so i was told…one of the conditions of okaying me to live here is knowing she will be out). the other room was the parents until they renovated the whole garage which now is done and has a master bedroom, a bedroom for the younger brother, and a loft. now it’s for us to “borrow” for our girls to use but any guests that ever stay will stay in that room and the kids all back upstairs during that time. even to borrow, their other son is living in the rv on the property (not a part of the initial deal he’s a druggy and got kicked out of everywhere with no place to go….there is a space behind the small bedroom downstairs that he has inhabited for gaming and doing weed (one of the initial agreements was he can’t smoke weed at all here otherwise he can’t stay. the parents agreed and they already fell through with no backbone). there is a door to the stairs separating the up and down but we can hear everything and they can hear us (no privacy). the dad also took in two cats without asking us to be outdoor to kill the mice on the property (which they don’t) and because i was raised with animals they put on me to take care and feed them without asking because they had no idea what they were doing. the conditions i had for living here that i discussed with hubby:-i get the whole garage to turn into a photography studio for business (they still have their things in it)-the sister was suppose to move to utah in a year or two so she wouldn’t be “forever” (now she sounds like she’s changing her tune and never wants to move, get married, or have kids) she is also living here rent free even though she works-the youngest brother in high school will go on a mission in 4 years and then will be out -we would “eventually” get the whole house and the parents would have the renovated garage***note the druggy brother was never a part of the picture…also living rent freehere’s why venting:we just discovered we’re pregnant again that would make us 2 adults plus 4 children under the age of 5 and a dog all upstairs with the one bedroom and one office space (and “maybe” one room downstairs) they heard something that “spooked them” and now the sister is trying to get the druggy brother to stay in the room downstairs just so we can’t (both the two living rent free) nobody knows we are pregnant yet. with this change i think we should get the whole house now. the druggy brother stays in the rv (still rent free and doing his weed which again frustrating the parents didn’t stick to the rules)…he makes our whole house smell like weed which is nauseating being pregnant. the sister can live in the loft upstairs in the garage i’ve seen there is tons of space (the only thing is they have a “storage unit” of stuff still…which the mom is kinda of a hoarder…but again with their space is they have 4 greenhouses too that are empty for storage. we have only hand a room by the heater downstairs same place the druggy brother hangs out.) all i want is privacy to let my kids cry it out. my son wakes up every other hour at night because we share a room and senses me so i have to feed him every time and i get high anxiety trying not to wake them downstairs. the two girls sharing that office keep each other awake playing until midnight at least (we put them down 8-9pm) so get cranky during the day from crappy sleep. the other factor is hubby’s dad does not take care of himself and has diabetes. years ago i asked all the siblings one by one their thoughts on their dad and all believed he wouldn’t last until the youngest brothers high school graduation (4 years from now) if he passes my husband would run the family business and we could afford the place by ourselves and buy the mom out….or he is also an only child and his parents are also going to go soon so everything would go to the dad (they live on a 2 acre property) one room the parents and one room for that youngest brother and then we would just sell this place. we looked at all the options before me agreeing to this. i told husband that either i would want the whole house or they buy us out of our part/we sell out old duplex we lived in/we buy our own place with the exact 4-5 rooms we would need. according to him his dad can afford this place on his own. even if we moved he still has the two kids living rent free he could charge or they all move in the house the rent free downstairs and the parents and youngest upstairs and could rent out the garage too….basically there is lots of options. i just want to know asap because houses are going fast right now. hubby insists we are not moving. he said we could turn the walk in closest into a bedroom (that still leaves the girls keeping each other awake and an extra baby) or he said renovate half the garage into a bedroom (one no heating not safe and that takes away the space for my photography studio the whole selling point for me gruntingly okay to move with them. plus we don’t have the money to renovate the garage to be safe for kids. i also never liked this place because personally upstairs it’s only a shower and my peace for the day every day before was a hot bath to get away from the kids. i have no peace. there are no locks on any of the doors, the heating/ac sucks and is always cold no matter what i adjust it too (the kids refuse a shower so idk the last time they even have been cleaned…yes disgusting.)they have a bath downstairs but it’s so cluttered down there and again the druggy brother is always down there in the day i don’t feel comfortable having my kids naked anywhere near him. again “privacy issues”.they also have a dog they have a crate in their garage (they call the lodge) but all day at work will leave her downstairs in a border thing where she is whining all day while nobody is home again except the druggy brother who barely does anything. i can hear that dog every day.i guess what i’m looking for in all of this is 1. is it wrong for me wanting the whole house being pregnant now running out of space? and just wanting privacy? they are on the downgrade of life and we are going up if that makes sense… who knows if we’ll have more kids in the future and stay cramped with space. (that’s why i’m willing to move)2. hubby seems stubborn not to move, i feel trapped and can already feel the depression kicking in and has been mildly since we moved in september and more now being pregnant (i’m terrified/anxious nothing will change…)3. is it wrong to assume they should adapt to us in this scenario since we adapted to them bringing in their druggy son…they also gave him a car that he doesn’t have to pay for so he can get to his job. but again pays for nothing.4. hubby has told me not to say anything to anyone because it will “spook” them and they will hold on tighter. he said he will “supposedly” talk to them because it’s “politics”….i just find that ridiculous. other backstory hubby and i are high school sweethearts and have now dated 12 years married for 6. in high school his mom would force my guy on dates with other girls to try to break us up because she didn’t like how serious we were (i knew what i wanted in life and i knew he was a great guy worth waiting for) she didn’t even care to try to get to know me and i even joined the church and we’re the only ones of her children who got sealed in the temple like she would want. the oldest sister not here got pregnant 3 times with the same guy and married just because of it (he treats her like crap) their kids are psycho cause trouble irresponsible. ours are well mannered respectful of people’s things. it seems like no matter how hard i try his family is still selfish and has no respect for me (imagine the cool table in high school and you can’t sit with them or you do and they ignore you…yes it’s literally that ridiculous) they don’t care to engage with me even though i try. it’s like i’m the outsider and expendable to them. mother in law made a comment during games yesterday which verified that in-laws (those not blood) don’t deserve anything or bare minimum) like how are they members of the church? i just grew up knowing what i wanted and honestly wanted in laws who were like family it was mother in law it was mom and siblings were the same…i’ve accepted that it won’t be that but all i said when moving with hubby was there had to be boundaries and it seems to go out the window with them. anytime they have an issue big or small they alway call my husband over (last time it was 11pm to get a lizard out of their garage…who cares that they had the two other sons and daughter fully capable) i also asked from my hubby just for the kids to seem him at least 1 hour a day that’s it. he can do whatever he wants otherwise but his family keeps getting in the way of that. all i want is boundaries, privacy, comfort…is that seriously too much of us ask? i feel like hubby won’t cut the chord with them. i keep telling him i’m not saying he can’t see his family but i am saying me and the kids now need to be the priority over them for a healthy marriage. am i crazy? ugh again i feel trapped, depressed, and nobody talk to. idk what to do…if you read all this god bless you i really just needed to be heard by someone.",2.0,0.0,1638759354.0,depression

"i am transgender, and i am losing hope.",illyreal,"hey all. i'm illy, i've been actively transitioning medically for just about 2 years now, my first dose of spiro and estrogen were on dec. 21st 2019. i've been struggling for months or years beyond with suicidal thoughts, and i am so concerned that i am getting closer to the edge.a bit about me, i have lived a pretty rough life. i grew up in a broken family, just like so many other kids, and one with a highly queerphobic father. he used to tell me stories about how proud he was growing up in the 60's beating up gay folk for being gay. we never had a lot of money for things that we wanted, we had a lot of things that he wanted, like the hockey gear that he bought so that he could make me be a goaltender, but when it came to pursuing my own interests it was always short on change. growing up was rough, we moved every few years so he could dodge his income taxes a bit longer. i never really set down roots or understood how to make a lasting friend.i didn't know i was trans for a really really long time. i was 26 (late 2016) when i first started questioning why i never felt like i looked right, and through various throwaways and therapy i came to my ultimate conclusion. by this point i had already gotten with the person i thought i was going to be with forever, and we had a lovely little family with two children that i was providing for. one hers, and one ours. revealing that i am who i am, and how i am, broke our family. within a year or so, our relationship fell apart, she split (late 2017, early 2018) and separated me from the eldest child who i had raised from birth with her, as he went to live with his other biological parent. i was left, alone, with my girl and my grief. when i think back, this is the moment i never seem to be able to get over. therapy helped stem the bleeding, but i've never really healed. how could i when i've lost a child? for a while i managed to keep it together and kept working my job, i was in a really well paying secure position with an aluminum smelter, but my anxiety at not being my authentic self drove me to leave both that position and my hometown in attempt to pursue my truth.the intervening years, barring my transition, have been hell. i left my hometown in april of 2019, and by the end of november of 2019 i was finding myself in a position where i wasn't going to be able to comfortably or even basically provide for my daughter. at that time my ex had moved on and moved together to the city we were living in with her new partner, and they were in a financial / life position that was going to be better for the wee one. i made the decision at that time to send my girl to live with her mother, so that i could get back on my feet and get my transition stuff started. i needed to live authentically. well. covid happened. i wasn't able to find work for approximately 18 months during the pandemic, stuff having been shut down as it was and leading into my inability to work positions similar to what i had worked up to at that point in my life, i was stuck. during this period of my life, being down without my children, without my love, starving and clinging desperately to the fact that ""at least i was medically transitioning"" has probably been the hardest of my life. i seriously contemplated my death a few times during this period, i even called the suicide hotline a couple times and i was left on hold. my best friend pulled me out of my rut during this period a few times just enough to dust me off and keep me moving, even just a little. during this period i have been also waiting on surgical assessments for my bottom surgery, since in canada (specifically bc) we have a lengthy waiting process in order to qualify for covered gender affirming surgeries.then, an opportunity. i got a call for a job offer in a new sector back in my home town, at a good rate of pay with lots of overtime opportunity. i finally felt like maybe the cards were turning around at this point. maybe, just maybe, i could get back home and put my hustle back on so i could prepare a place to have my girl home with me again. i finally got the paperwork and assessments put through so i could go for my surgery. i finally think, ""here we are, we did it, it's all coming together"".i just got the news that it's going to be several more months to years of waiting before i am likely to get in for my surgery. i found out that my income vs debt won't allow me to get any form of mortgage. rentals are far, far too expensive for any single income to afford here. i just faced down a brutal abuse by a guy i thought was going to be my partner, he led me on for months until we finally were intimate, just to turn around and say ""i want this to be a secret, i have a woman i am interested in making my wife and i don't want anything to mess that up."" i made an impulsive decision to order a bunch of computer parts for a much needed upgrade, and the delays on the shipping on them all have me so beyond hope they will ever actually show up that it feels like i just spent $1500 for nothing.i am drowning. i am suffocating. i am back in this small northern bc town away from my best friend in this world, i still don't have my daughter home, i don't know that i ever will, and i feel so hopeless. i no longer want to live. i don't want to die, i could never do that to my baby, but i do not want to live. i am constantly hounded by my ever present gender dysphoria. i need my surgery to help, i want to feel right, and nothing is working out. i have no family support. i am scared that i am going to finally break through that final line and just end it all. that thought terrifies me because i don't know how much more of this life i can take, before the thought of hurting my girl by hurting myself is no longer enough to keep me here. i need help, and it feels like nobody can help me.",2.0,1.0,1619644738.0,depression

life is pointless,archer4364,"why in the hell are we still going? you die at the end, and life is undeniably more pain than pleasure. what's not pain or pleasure is monotony. the only reason we don't kill ourselves is because the will to live is too great, and because it's a lot of work. and those around us that depend on us to keep going and not ruin their lives. what are we working towards? you make money to live, just to die later. money means nothing. the endless 9-5 grind we slave away it isn't really something you can pretend is worth it. and the relationships you make will **all** end, and they will all end in sadness unless you're the one who dies at the end and you don't have to suffer any longer. death is an end to suffering. those with spirituality or religion will feel differently, and as someone who does not have either, i don't despise them, i envy them. i'm way too depressed to do any more hallucinogenic drugs and try to ego-death my way out of not giving a shit about being alive but it feels like a bad idea. getting therapy is a bigger obstacle than it needs to be because i'm so depressed, and i don't even trust therapists because why should i trust anybody else? i am 100% pessimistic and i do not trust any other people. my cat, the only point to my life and the only thing i gave a shit about is dead and all i can do to fill the hole is sink deeper into alcoholism, and smoking marijuana every single day to feel numb. why am i killing myself slowly when i don't even want to be alive? there's just no end. death should not be feared, it's an absence of pleasure but also an absence of pain. life is full of pain. why do you keep going? obligation? lack of motivation to follow through?",1.0,1.0,1371440638.0,depression

depressed and haven’t told anyone,akwardpansexualblob,"hi,so i have taken many online tests (including the official nhs one, which is for over 18s and i am under so that’s saying something) which have all come out with the same result: i have moderate to severe depression. i know it too i’ve lost interest in things, don’t want to socialise anymore, get really teary and snap at people often, hopeless, tired as if i had an all nighter even if i had a 12 hour sleep, constant muscle and joint pain and etc. and i’ve told no one apart from maybe a couple months ago when i didn’t look into it too much i told my friends saying i might have depression and they didn’t really care. i feel the need for help so i went to my school counsellor and they advised me to some program thingy, but the amount of times i’ve hinted without saying it that i have depression, because i am self diagnosed even though i have all the symptoms not including lack of apitite, and they either choose to ignore it or don’t understand. imagine, a 13 year old walks into your office saying they’re self diagnosed with depression. no one will believe me. my parents broke up not too long ago, covid and all that, i have never had a stable friendship and more toxic friends than you can count so the reason is pretty self explanatory. i don’t know what to do because i know i need treatment but i feel like no one will believe me. another thing is that i do not remember what it feels like to be genuinely happy. if you ask the people i know they will say i’m the happiest person they know but this is because i always have a fake smile on. now i can’t cry properly when i have the chance because i’ve trained myself to be able to cry without making any sound and holding back. i have suicidal and self harming thoughts that wonder into my mind a lot; i never want to go through with them but the fact remains that they are there. what should i do? i need your help please :) mainly on what to tell people and how to tell them if possible thanks guys hope u get better too :)",2.0,1.0,1638743816.0,depression

need some help,Wichita92,"everyone…i really need your help. i’ve never been the one to turn to the internet and random people for reassurance or advice, but i’m in a really low spot.i’ve read almost every single thing about suicide at this point. the devastation it causes to loved ones, the permanence of an unthinkable action. and even though there are days where i feel so depressed that i sometimes wish i wasn’t alive anymore, i could never ever go through with an action that would hurt those around me.that’s the problem, you see i’m very aware of my actions. im very aware that i have a family who loves me dearly and would do anything for me. i’ve voiced my depression and anxiety to them for years and have been very transparent. i’ve seen about 8 different psychiatrists, therapists, psychologist and social workers and nothing has helped. i’ve read self help books. i’ve tried multiple ssri’s and antidepressants, anti-anxiety meds and adhd meds (all of which had no reaction or made my condition worse…aka the worst depression i’ve ever felt). i’ve worked out consistently and made dietary changes. i’ve done so much and i know deep down is that any self-help needs me to stay diligent but i never put the work in (which can be blamed a lot on my diagnosed adhd). part of my depression is that i always feel lazy. i slack off at work, yet still continuously get promoted. i never do things if they’re too hard, i always try to find a shortcut.i hate that i need to have things a certain way or obsess over thoughts and consequences of my actions (i also have diagnosed ocd).truth be told, i just hate myself more and more. i was bullied for years growing up, i didn’t have many friends until i went to college. then i had a bunch and a girlfriend for a few years. when i left college i had made new friends and kept some. now ive lived in a new state for a couple years, have hardly made friends with anyone despite joining clubs, sports teams, work outings and so forth. i’m extremely social, i used to have no anxiety about conversation with total strangers and now, for the first time ever, i’m more and more nervous. i can’t meet a girl for the life of me. every time i do, they end up being an alcoholic, manipulative or don’t have enough in common with me.i just feel lost. i’m not happy anymore, at least not with any normal consistency like i used to have. i don’t want to continue, but suicide isn’t an option. i try to do things for myself all the time. i treat myself to things, like vacations and such. but i take them alone, so i feel like shit when i’m on them.i don’t know what to do anymore. prescriptions are no longer an option in my book (too many bad experiences and i’ve seen pharmaceuticals wreck havoc in my family). i’ve tried multiple holistic things too like ashwaghanda, and others to no avail. i have no motivation to see another counselor, or keep up with things like cbt.i know this just feels like a rambling vent…and for any who have made it this far i really appreciate you taking the time to listen to a stranger. quite frankly, i’m not sure i even know what i’m looking for by posting this. but i needed to say something because i’m hurting so much inside.",2.0,3.0,1638741849.0,depression

nonprofit focused on addressing male hesitancy to therapy through golf,Suspicious_Tomato266,"hi! my team and i recently launched a nonprofit in the us focused on **addressing male hesitancy to mental healthcare through golf**. the organization essentially organizes scramble-style outings for our participants (we call them 'members') and embeds therapist/psychiatrist-curated group exercises in each foursome to introduce the golfers to the style in which therapy is presented and used (e.g., 18-questions for the group, one per hole, increasing in how personal or sensitive the topic is hole-to-hole). after the round, should any member have found benefit from the exercises, we have local therapy practices on hand to answer additional questions (or simply hear about how the round went, they're great listeners).the **most important aspect to make this successful is the members themselves** \- if you, or anyone you know, may be interested - please give [**scramblegolfclub.com**](https://scramblegolfclub.com/) a visit and fill out the contact form ([https://www.scramblegolfclub.com/contact](https://www.scramblegolfclub.com/contact))! we'll be organizing outgoings via clusters of zip codes so the more folks in your area, the greater likelihood one of the first outings will be a town near you. unfortunately we’re only focusing on the us for the time being but hope to eventually have chapters abroad as well.separately - appreciate any and all thoughts and feedback. we're a small team and value any help and advice!cheers - sgc",1.0,0.0,1628174876.0,depression

i'm doomed to never be happy,throwaway98104825,"i'm a trans man. there is no denying that to myself anymore. i'll never be comfortable being a women. i tried to convince myself i hated it for simply gender roles and objectification. it didn't work, they were all lies and fake.i'll never be happy with my body. even if i transition fully, i'll never feel correct. i'll always be wrong and broken. i'll always have scars that i have look at in the mirror. features of what estrogen damaged that i can't fix. my hips are almost/all bone, they'll never be as slim as they should have been. i look at transition photos and the hips still look too wide. my hands, feet, and arms will never be big. i'll never be even close to the average man's height. i could care less about dating issues, that's the least of my concerns. sure, some might say, many men have those features and they're cis. yes, they might, but at least theirs was due to simply *bad luck*, they simply got the shit end of the stick. i'm biologically female, i got those features because of *that*, not shit luck and chances are, most don't have the *majority* of those features at the same fucking time. that is what fucking hurts.my skeleton will always be female. i'll have to live with the knowledge that *thing* is in me, no matter how much i want to just tear it out. i'll have jab myself with a needle, apply gel, or something else for the rest of my life, not have it happen naturally. i'll never have xy chromosomes. my parents will never love me and would disown me. i don't blame them, they already have a real son, i'm second class.i don't understand. every. single. one. of my guy relatives and friends get to be male. they get to go through the right puberty naturally. except me. why was i born wrong? i think of the life i would've had if i was right. everything would have been right and i should have been him. i'll start to form tears even if i simply imagine to hear ""its a boy!', seeing him going through puberty like every other guy, or imagine that little boy with his family. i'll never be able to accept i can't be him. i just wish this was a terrible nightmare or i'm in a coma relieving my life as a girl, and when i wake up i'll see my family relieved and asking if their son/grandson/nephew is okay.i don't want to die but i don't want to live either. i don't think i could bear the idea of living and never being him. trans people say you'll eventually accept you'll never be cis and will be happy with your transition, but that isn't an option for me. i could have been happy, but it was taken away from me the second i got a second x chromosome and my fate was sealed. i'm already a dead man walking. i just want the dysphoria and pain to end. i want to drink, maybe myself to death, but i can't because i'm underage. i can't even do that. i wouldn't care if he was a completely different person because at least he wouldn't have to go through this. i feel tired, hopeless, and doomed.",2.0,1.0,1638651745.0,depression

why the last 4 years have left me feeling hopeless.,jdex89,way back in 2018 i finally moved out of my parents house with my gf at the time into a small apartment. i was unemployed in that time but quickly found a job at a milk plant and struggled to adapt to the new situation but still managed to get through it with my gf. about six months into my new job she lost hers and i invited her to work with me at the milk plant since we have similar work backgrounds. we were on the same shift car pooling spending time together and it was stressful in more ways than one but still we made it work. another 4 months go by and my gf invites her best friend to work with us as well and she practically lived with us for the next year we all worked together at the same place while i tried to maintain it all i felt overworked and streched thin trying to keep my relationship stable while helping our mutual friend and struggling to keep a good work ethic. it was hard through it all but finally my gfs friend got her own car and it was just us again at the start of 2020 but by that time i noticed my gfs behavior was different. always on the phone with someone who was listed in her contacts with a nickname. i didint think much of it as i was trying to get promoted to make more money but it all really came clear when my gf wanted to go see some old friends one weekend and no matter how much i asked she refused to give any real details. i was always open with her never hiding anything and letting her do whatever she wanted but the signs where clear that she was messing with someone else. i mentally denied it for a while as i truly believed she would never do something like this but eventually i had to confront the truth and break up with her. i was so devastated i packed up the bare minimum of my stuff and got my own apartment. if that wasn’t enough i still had to work with her and what’s worse is i found out the guy she was messing with was twice her age and someone i kinda looked up to. this is when i started slipping up at work a lot finding it hard to think but thank god my family supported me through what was the roughest part of my life so far. eventually my now ex moved in with her much older new bf and switched shifts but i would still occasionally see him on mine when he worked overtime. i would get so angry my head would hurt just knowing he was in the same building as me but i told myself i needed to live better to be better but the damage was mostly done as i was soon on my final written warning at work for making so many mistakes. and the inevitable finally happened. i was fired because i didint catch a mistake someone else made when it went through my machine and was knocked down emotionally again. a part of me was happy i’ll never see that shit place again but i had great friends there i dearly miss but i picked myself up and told myself this is an opportunity to live for myself and choose a better future on my terms tied down by no one. but that changed when i tried to get unemployment hoping that will get me through until i could get a new job but instead i was left in the dark not knowing if i was approved or not my bills piled up quickly and i tried every phone number and email i could find but still to this day nothing no unemployment money no confirmation if i was approved or not i quickly started having panic attacks even now as i write this i’m mentally freaking out. the only good news is my parents are paying for my bills which leaves me feeling pathetic and like all this is my fault. my mental issues have never been hitting me so hard as they are now and i just don’t know what to do a part me feels like when i get a new job i’ll just fuck it up again and again. i don’t know what i want for my future because every path i could take looks like it won’t go anywhere because of the way the world is right now i truly feel hopeless and trapped.,2.0,0.0,1466634676.0,depression

how do you tell the people you love you want to die,bairh_throwaway,"i  need to vent. i don't talk to my friends or family about this and i'm  overflowing right now. this may come off as woe is me but i can't keep  this in anymore and just need a place to release.tw: self harm and sexual assaulti  called a crisis line today sobbing and was told no one could come out  until tomorrow at the earliest and tomorrow wasn't even guaranteed. i  haven't left my house in about two months. i'm not eating or sleeping  well, i've been crying for the last three days and just relapsed with  sh.i'm in my late 20s. every  single time i have reached out for help i have been turned away in some  form. i went to a doctor in my first year of university crying saying i  was suicidal and she pretty much told me there's nothing she can do. no  resources or somewhere else to try just nothing she could do. when i  asked if i could take a moment to get myself together since i was  crying, she told me to go to the bathroom. i get doctors are busy and  she probably had someone waiting to come in but that was the first time i  asked for help and her reaction made me bottle up and i didn't try to  access help for years after.when i  got a therapist a few years ago, i walked into the building and burst  into tears. i had (and still never have) told anyone about the sexual  assault i experienced in childhood and walking into the appointment i  was terrified. when i was invited into the room, already with tears  streaming down my face, i had to ask her around 20\~ minutes into the  session for some tissues since they were across the room. again, she's a  person and i know she wasn't withholding tissues to further upset me  but that introduction didn't make me feel safe with her so again, i  bottled up and got nothing out of my few sessions with her.i  could go on but there's no reason to, this isn't a unique experience.  i'm just exhausted. i can't believe i'm going to feel like this for the  rest of my life. i can't feel like this for the rest of my life it truly  isn't worth it.i was assaulted  twice when i was in the 8th grade and my trauma response to it was to  completely bury it. i was in my early 20s when i remembered the first  assault, that's how good my brain was at erasing it, and only realized  the second one was assault shortly after that. ever since these memories  returned, they play in a constant loop in my brain. i'll be having a  fine day and all of a sudden i'm back in that bed paralyzed and it's  debilitating. i had two of my best friends visit me back in october for  the first time since covid hit and i ruined one of our last nights  together because i got sucked back in and couldn't snap out of it.i  feel like i don't have any control of my emotions, my life or my  future. i have no money, i don't have a job and i can't bring myself to  get a job because honestly what is the point? what am i working towards?i  should have talked to the people in my life earlier because i now lack  the ability or courage to. how do i start this conversation when my body  physically rejects the words and it gets stuck in my chest. i guess  that's what anonymity on this internet is for.thoughts  of suicide are the only thing that calms me down at this point. maybe  calms me down isn't the right wording but more levels me out. it's  reassuring to me that i have an out but i promised myself i wouldn't  while my parents are alive.i'm  unsure where i am right now mentally. i've been crying constantly for  days but i don't feel anything, i'm hallow. i haven't been in this place  before where i have these intense outward emotions and outbursts but  feel nothing inside if that makes sense.i  just don't know what to do anymore and truthfully don't want to do  anything anymore. i'm rotting away in this isolated hole i dug for  myself and i'm just making it deeper and deeper so i can't get out. when  i do start and attempt to climb out i just fall down even deeper.how  do i ask for help when i don't have the words? i just don't know what  to do. i don't want to think or feel like this anymore but i can't get  out of the spiral.thanks for readingtldr; how do you ask for help after hiding your pain for so long",2.0,0.0,1638652542.0,depression

i’m in love with a girl who doesn’t feel the same about me,superherofan23,"in fall of 2019 i meet the love of my life and i really mean that. i’ve never spent as much time with any woman and genuinely enjoyed it as much as i did with her. we’re weren’t dating, but we weren’t limited to friendship, or at least i didn’t think so. we spent almost every day together whether it was in person or on facetime. i shared things with her that i’ve never shared with any other human being on this planet. i’ve gotten involved in physical fights over her. i never tell anyone in my family about people i am romantically involved with but i told them about her. i truly thought me and her would spend the rest of our lives together. however, over time i noticed i started getting obsessed with her and eventually began stalking her. but that’s not when things went sour. stupidly i started emotionally pulling away i don’t know if that was because i knew my obsessive behaviors would end up ruining our relationship or because deep down i knew that she didn’t want to be with me but i did it. and when i did that was when my life turned to shit and the depression kicked in. around the time of our relationship deteriorating quarantine began also. so as if i already wasn’t lonely enough without her covid amplified that x1000. i don’t have any friends and i don’t talk to my family about personal issues so the pain i felt i had to deal with. i’ve been bodybuilding for the past 6 years so i thought focussing primarily on that would end the pain…it didn’t. every now and then we would interact but it was on occasion. then when shit got really dark was when i saw her prom pictures(even though i stopped stalking her physically i never stopped cyber stalking). she was with her new boyfriend this resulted in me having a mental breakdown(wasn’t the first time i had a breakdown over her). i cried all night wondering why i had to see that or what does he have that i don’t then i accepted the fact that she never felt the same way about me that’s when i decided i was going to kill myself. i then went and got my dads gun and held it to my head i cried and cried when i finally pulled the trigger nothing happened it was because the gun was on safety after some more crying i decided i wasn’t going to follow through with it. after that a dark period in my life like no other began. i started self harming in various ways wondering why i had to witness her in love with someone who wasn’t me. eventually i got over it and her(or so i thought). just once i stopped self harming and thought the depression was ending i went to my schools open house for my senior year. there i talked to her and learned we had a class together. after she told me that i thought this was going to be some sort of miracle or divine intervention. i believed that this would be when me and her rekindle our relationship. once school started i realized this was way worse. me and her hang around different crowds(she has a clicky friend group. i don’t have friends at all). we never interacted and i constantly saw her in class was flirting with this guy. seeing that started a whole new wave of depression. i began self harming again and eventually attempted suicide again(this time i tried to hang myself with an extension chord) my second real attempt failed as the wood pole i hang the extension chord from snapped. so the cycle continued me stalking her, self harming, and eventually thinking i got over her(i didn’t). now more time has passed and i saw something earlier that ruined me, it was a tiktok of her and an old friend of mine announcing their relationship. and i really thought the pain i felt when i saw her with her ex boyfriend was bad. seeing that made me realize there’s no point in continuing this endless cycle of pain…so i’m going to give myself two more days before i kill myself. if in these next two days i can’t get over her and become happy again(i won’t). im going to kill myself through od(i can’t fail this one). when i close my eyes all i can see is her smile and all i can hear is her voice i’m tired of not being able to be with her. and my life isn’t worth living without her-for anyone who read this in its entirety i’m sorry for the grammatical errors i’m currently cutting myself and crying",1.0,2.0,1566783154.0,depression

on new meds and having some weird dreams,dwiggs81,"so, about a week ago i enrolled in a medical trial for a depression medication. it's the third stage trial, meaning that all participants receive actual medication, the double-blind study where placebos were used is over. i've really felt better, more energy overall, and haven't been putting myself down like i used to. i've also been less anxious when talking to new people and making plans to get together with friends. it's only been a week, but i can see some good things happening. however, the last week i've also had some of the worst, most fucked up dreams i've had in a while. one was about my parents divorcing from which i woke up crying like a child, one was me screaming profanities at my father, and last night was about me basically being abandoned and left alone by friends, family, and everyone else in the dream. could this be a sign that my brain is trying to finally work through and process personal frustrations? is this a desperate attempt my by sick brain to keep me in the uncomfortable-yet-known-and-understood cycle of depression where at least i can be reasonably secure of the outcome even though it's bad? has anyone else on new meds had weird dreams at the beginning and did they eventually stop?",1.0,1.0,1411278981.0,depression

well...,blackdaisylight,"a girl in my former friends group committed suicide on wednesday. she jumped from the 4th floor. she was struggling a lot and after a decade of fighting she gave in. she was 24. it's heartbreaking. i struggled with similar issues as her (depression, eating disorder) and it really moved something in me. this is gonna sound so cliché but it's really really not worth it. i remember when i was about 14 she pierced my nose and saw i had some sh cuts on my wrist and she told me: ""i did it as well but things will get better,you'll see"".now, she's dead and will never be able to see that things can, in fact, get better.what she did was in her mind the best option. i totally understand why as i can't even begin to imagine all the other stuff she was going through, but the void she left in the life of everyone who knew her, even if just a little, really sucks. at her funeral her little brother, mom and dad had a speech. it's surreal how her struggles came to an end but now her family has to live with the fact that she's gone. i don't know what the point of this post is but i guess what i wanna say is that even if you think no one loves you, they'd be better off without you or stuff like that, don't believe it. people care, people love you and you will be missed dearly if you decide to end it all. talk to someone, try new things, change routine, do whatever you feel might actively help you but don't kill yourself. at some point in the future you'll be able to look back at where you were and where you are now and you'll be proud of yourself. keep fighting and stay strong, not only  for your loved ones but for yourself.",2.0,1.0,1565366524.0,depression

"how do you explain what depression is like to people who thinks that depression is a ""choice""",jomjom95,"i am not clinically depressed but i do suspect that i might have had/having depression since i was a teen (i'm in my late twenties now) and only got better after i met my partner 2-3years back. i'd been holding back to seek help professionally due to financial constraints and the fact that i'd been getting better (suicidal thoughts are no longer frequent and i can get on with daily life tasks on most days). however, as some of you may know, it gets very draining on the person caring for someone with depression and i think that's what's happening now - my partner, who is a great bf and shows me what it's like to be loved unconditionally, is getting tired dealing with me. he used to be confident that we have a future together but he is no longer confident now, although he is not gonna give up on us (yet). i know this because we had a truthful talk.i, too, think that i am very hard to handle and deal with and i have problems controlling my emotions; so my partner wished for me to be able to control myself better as i may have random infrequent outbursts at times (which inflicts physical pain to myself and sometimes him when he is trying to stop me). i tried explaining to him how depression is a mental disorder, where therapy and medication is required, and that it is not a choice or decision where i can stop myself from overthinking or feeling depressed. he thinks that i am ""weak"" and can be ""stronger""/strong-willed by telling me things about myself that i already know. but it hurts me to hear it from him, no matter how small/insignificant the things he said about me; on bad days i'd get really triggered and that's when i have my outburts/breakdown. he said that it was a habit for him to ""joke"" around with people he's comfortable with, and he hopes that i would get ""immune"" to it and therefore, getting ""stronger"" mentally. i told him i do not see his comments as jokes and i deem it as very unnecessary as it hurts me, but he said i have to get through this hurdle to truely accept myself. i love him and don't wish to lose him, how do i get him to understand what depression or any mental illness is like? tldr: my partner does not understand depression/mental illnesses and thinks that people are in control of their own emotions/mind. for example, he tends to ask me to stop overthinking, or stop getting affected by insignificant things he said about me which hurts me.",1.0,2.0,1593360840.0,depression

i have no one to vent to. and my mentally abusive family.,pppoopoo1243,"i have no friends anymore. i have so many problems, alot i cannot discuss to some. my own family won't even let me. my step father is a hard ass who doesn't understand my issues. and everytime i bring my depression up to my mom she always makes it about her. she constantly berates me about stuff i do and threatens to divorce my step dad, and that hurts just thinking about it. and she constantly goes on mental breakdowns saying how she wants to die and kill herself. this has been happening since i was young. i still love them but its bull shit. i have problems to... at one point our brother had ordered pizza for us because we were really broke, they used a plate that i know has been in the cabinet for years never being washed and i said i didn't want any because i have extreme ocd. she heard one time when i said i wanted to kill myself on one of the few times i've said and, after the pizza debacle she yelled at me saying ""you said you wanted to kill yourself right?"" and threw a knife at my feet basically saying ""if your gonna do it do it, you what ill do it with ya"" she mentally abuses me and constantly makes everything about her. she makes everyones problems hers. and not in a good caring way, but in a great i have to deal with this shit, way. and in ways i get why she's the way she is. she was physically abused by my real father who was a drunk and wrote suicide notes everyday for my family. once even hanging nooses for each one of us including a 2 yo me. he eventually did kill himself by jumping in front of a train. so i understand her reasons to be the way she is. a lyric from a song explains it perfectly though ""i know its hard living a life like you, but it is not a justification for what you do"" one of my brothers got into a physical altercation with his pregnant wife and i tried stopping him and jumped on his back to put him in a sleeper hold. he threw me over his shoulders and started punching the shit out my face. after, his then wife (they divorced) threatened to divorce him and take their 2 kids. he went into a breakdown and tried killing himself with a kitchen knife and my mom had to fight the knife away from him. i had to watch my ""buddy"" try to kill himself. this happens 3 more times. and one was on the day we buried my grandpa. and it was all because he spent 100 dollars on e cig shit. and i had enough and ran away. they later picked me up but things weren't fixed yet. fast forward to co**d era, my mom is extremely scared of c**id, and won't let me do anything even now that i'm 18. she says she doesn't care but its obvious she does because she acts in a ""ok you can do it, but if you do ill hate you for it"" way. i can't even see my grandma and uncle will, who are in their later years. in the past 2 years i've seen them probably 7 times. i hate it. i just don't wanna live like this anymore. my family sheltered me so i'm extremely socially awkward and have anxiety doing anything remotely out of my comfort zone. so working or even walking 10 minutes down the street, i feel im going to get attacked by a dog or get hurt by someone. i've been in homeschool my whole life essentially so i have no social skills. everything just feels stacked against me. and i feel i dont have anyone to go about it. again, my mom hates when i do, my step dad doesn't care, my oldest brother is preachy and always compares our situation and implies what he went through was harder and he got over it, which may be true but saying my problems aren't that bad doesn't help, my 2d oldest is still immature and has anger issues and my other brother i hate, for private reasons. i've got no one. it helps to write my problems like this. i don't know if ill even post but even just writing it helps me out sometimes. i just want to be happy and not be constantly nervous about each decision i make or feel like if i do something my mom would do something again. i'm so scared to live, but i'm still scared to die. and i just don't know how to fix these problems...",3.0,1.0,1602873632.0,depression

i'm never going to be happy,AceBuilder1109,"the title really sums it up. not that anyone will read it anyway but i just have to get this off my chest. i seriously feel like i'll never be happy, and it feels like the world wants me to just suffer. this is probably gonna be jumbled but anyway here goes. so i'll start with the fact that i happened to get a girlfriend a couple days ago, and i'm happy about that. but at the same time, i have such low self esteem that it's gonna take a long while to actually get it through my head that someone genuinely likes me and wants to be with me. and it's that same self hatred that makes me feel unworthy of her, and that she doesn't deserve to have to deal with my broken arse. plus like, i'll be going away to college next fall, and i don't want to hurt her by having to leave her (i couldn't do a distance relationship, and we want different things out of life anyway). on a slightly different note, after months of trying and looking, i'm finally in a band with people that care about the band, and we're actually making music! i take a look at my life and see that i have literally everything i've ever wanted, but i still hate my life and i know i'm so ungrateful and i absolutely despise myself for it; i don't deserve to even exist. and kinda going back to what i mentioned earlier, as far as going to college, that is a whole other issue in and of itself. getting accepted is no issue, my grades have always been outstanding (although gifted kid burnout syndrome is starting to set in). but a lot of it deals with money. i need a car for my plans and aspirations (being in a band: i can't go anywhere with instruments without my own vehicle, and i don't wanna leach off anyone else), which means i need a job to pay for car payments and car insurance. but i can't get a job, literally everywhere i've contacted hasn't gotten back to me after months of me contacting them back over and over again. it's probably because i can only work weekends and a couple hours at night, because i do sports all year. so at this rate, i won't be able to afford a car, which means i won't be able to get a job in college either, because i won't be able to go to any job, so that i still won't be able to afford a car, so i'm screwed. you'll probably say i'm a pessimist, but i think i'm being realistic when i say that i'm only 17 and my hopes and dreams for the future are already down the toilet. i feel like no matter what happens, i'll never be happy, and i'm so sick of existing, i don't want to do this anymore. life is just suffering, there's no point in it.and on a side note, if anyone read this, please don't say anything about how god has a plan or how jesus loves me, i don't believe in any of that. thanks for trying to help, but just don't bring theology into it.i'd also like to add that i was seeing a therapist for a bit, but i now have no time to, so yeah, that's that too.",4.0,1.0,1599428996.0,depression

venting about people being selfish (very long),user0620,"it's quite discouraging how so many people are selfish narcissistic snobs. what i'm about to vent about is associated with my depression in the sense that i'm keenly aware of other failing to appreciate the efforts of others when it threatens their own inflated egos.i can approach this topic from many different angles, but i'll just focus on piano playing, because i've got similar results from several different people.now, i'm not a classically trained pianist or anything, but i like learning to play songs on piano, specifically ragtime compositions by scott joplin. it takes a week or two of consistent practice for me to learn a song, but when i do i can play it well as written. i need to have the right mindset about it, and some imagination that i might be able to perform for others. many times when i've had the opportunity to play around others, i get a response that's like getting slapped in the face by a wet fish.early on when i was learning, i had gone to someone's house and noticed they had a piano and showed interest in playing around with it, but i was told, 'no, that's for my mother'. ok, i guess i can't argue with that. but that was only the first time this sort of thing happened.one time i was playing at a friend's house on a plastic casio keyboard and his mother came into the room and said, 'you know, i bought that keyboard so (her daughter) could learn how to play.' i don't know, that was kind of as expected coming from her. i said that i wasn't preventing (her daughter) from learning how to play. as a matter of fact, she had that keyboard for several years and seemed to have given up on playing. but it rubbed her the wrong way that i was playing the piano with the tiniest smidgen of proficiency. i was trying to encourage her son to learn some too, but i guess that toy piano was intented to turn (her daugher) into a concert pianist.around the same time, i was playing that same piano and one of my friend's parents, who is friend of the parents of the friend's house in question, had come into the room after i had finished playing, saying, 'you know, i used to play piano', played a single c chord and walked off. no mention of my piano playing at all. for all i know he was better than i'll ever be in his youth, but clearly didn't care that i was learning to play. but he was successful in sticking that memory into my head for a lifetime.i was at another friend's apartmet some years later and played a little bit of their plastic casio keyboard set up in the corner, but was quickly told to stop because 'that's what his girlfriend does.' i'd never really heard her play anything, but it is what it is i guess. this friend would never want to hear me play piano, because is his mind, his girlfriend is the only piano player he cares to hear. she was there too, and had no interest in critiquing my playing or even showing me that she could play at all. i don't know, i thought music was supposed to be a fun thing that people can share with and learn from others.even my own grandmother did this exact same thing to me once. she had bought a plastic casio keyboard to learn how to play in her old age, and i was just beginning to learn too. but she told me that she bought that so she could learn how to play piano. i didn't get any praise from her for ever learning to play an instrument. i never held it against her - it's discouraging to be at an advanced age and want to learn how to do something that takes significant practice and dexterity to learn how to do. i really don't care much to share this instance of being balked at for playing piano - but my own grandmother even. it's not her fault though and it's probably more complicated than i can explain all at once.after a while, i lost interest in playing piano. it wasn't fun for me to learn anymore, knowing i'd had so few opportunities to play for others and even fewer that would be well recieved. so i went around ten years without practicing at all - forgetting how to play nearly everything i had learned up to a certain point.recently, i had become interested in learning to play again because my sisters and their children were beginning to learn to play. i set up my grandmother's plastic casio keyboard in the main room and kept it in a good spot to learn to practice. after some time of significant practice (enough to suffer from tennis elbow injury), i had relearned most of the songs i had forgotten how to play and learned some new ones too.then this thanksgiving came. we were going to my sister's house where she happened to have her own plastic casio keyboard for her son to learn to pay. i was excited at the thought of playing what i learned and maybe showing the children what they can learn if they continue practicing. but what actually happened seemed to be a deliberate effort to disregard my attempts to play piano. it was subtle, but my sister seemed to time my arrival pulling into the driveway by getting everyone to gather round and watch her son play jingle bells, and i walk in with all the family cheering for him for playing  four note song with only his index finger. i don't think there's anything wrong with his playing really - my sister (who may or may not be inherently evil) is kind of forcing him to take lessons. he's not learning out of passion for music and seems to have more fun playing with the presets and obnoxious sound effects like most kids are.anyways, it took me a while but i eventually sat down at the keyboard and played just about everything i know for at least a half an hour. but not one child or adult expressed any interest in hearing me play the entire time i was there. the only thing any of my family said about my playing was to tell me to turn it down - which wasn't very loud to begin with.there was also an electric organ in the room, and when i'd sit down at the keyboard, one of my nieces would go over to the organ and play something with one finger. i eventually tried out the organ myself, never having played one, but my niece would go over to the keyboard and play something with one finger. i felt quite put down that no one cared to see me play and actual composition with two hands exactly as it was written. ragtime is something that's just as interesting to watch as it is to hear an as it's fun to play. but maybe no one likes listening to ragtime? maybe it is a little tacky and old fashioned. but when i hear ragtime i don't hear jingly jangly piano music - i feel a connection to the tragic artistry of scott joplin and the difficult life he lived.eventually, having gotten no joy out of my own efforts to play piano, i did put effort into encourging my niece to play and instructing her how to use more than one finger. by the end of the night, i had gotten her playing completely differently in such a way that complemented her singing ability more than just playing a melody with one finger. so i was satisfied with that, and she was happy. but what's it worth really? everyone is so selfish. what's the point of any of this if people only care about what their doing and offer no praise and encouragement to others? so i'm sitting here playing hundred year old rags and my niece is learning songs sung by her favorite trust fund baby social media influencers, but what's it worth really if even your own family can be so disinterested in what you're passionet about?anyways, i have a million different shit stories about how shitty my life is right now and how i don't even care to see 2022 the way things are going now. but this is just one aspect of life feeling pointless that i have to vomit out for the time being. just whatever. i wish i could wake up in one of my dreams and leave this shitty real life behind -

i am not sure of myself.,fiqahsha,"to make it clear, i have never ever been formally diagnosed as depressed or any other mental illness as mental health support is strangely expensive in my country. i am currently an architecture student, i supposed one could tell me as fortunate enough to get into such difficult course. however, the truth is i am struggling a lot. not because of the course itself but the way how university system is built, they don't accept people who refused to be in social events. i was forced to join all the social events. and there are a lot. they make me super stressed. i find myself to be shaking from time to time due to social stress. i find myself refusing to eat sometimes because i don't want to go to the cafeteria as i probably will meet someone from my course there. it's just so painful for me. people are so extroverted here to the point that they can't just leave me alone for my quality alone time. it's so tiring. everynight i find myself to be crying. sometimes i even have suicidal thoughts, though i can be assure that suicide is never my intention as my religion strictly prohibited the act of that. plus, i used to be the top student at my old school but now i am no longer one, i am probably one of the worst students here. it's very hard for me to find suitable peers to share this thought of mine. at first i was wondering why did my brain worked so differently than others? why did sadness just overwhelmed me so much? and then i realised maybe there is something wrong with my mental. any thoughts?thanks for reading anyway. i really appreciate it",1.0,3.0,1631971585.0,depression

giving up,someguy8079,"i'll be honest with you guys, i didn't know where to post this and just googled the premise, and this sub came up. i'm pretty definitely sure i was severely depressed the past few years, though undiagnosed. i've been working on myself and feel a lot better than i used to, but it's still lurking and i'm wondering if this is self-sabotage? reinventing myself and my values to avoid accountability? that's a heavy question best suited for a therapist, but all i've got right now is you- and on that note, do you think i should get a therapist? probably a dumb question. and

at 3am and breaking down again, feeling like i'm undoing all the work on myself i put in over the past few months. thanks.\~\~i have enough faith in myself to believe i’m in the right, but i think there’s always value in an outside take.   essentially, i’m “giving up"" on nearly everything i try, and i’d be lying if i said it doesn’t make me fee a bit guilty and lazy.   i was let go from my last “real” job at a golf course in early 2020. as a college student, and with the pandemic, i decided not to look for work. mid-year i took up an online customer service job, but i was in bad shape mentally and not the most outgoing person, so i gave it up pretty fast. by the end of the year i needed cash, so i took up gigging (doordash, grubhub, etc.) and did that until the snow came. by then i just wanted to relax, school was stressful and against my better judgment, i took unemployment. i lived on that until it ran out mid-year this year, and i didn’t extend it. a lot of guilt came with that, but i can't change the past.  i somehow managed to spend all of that money, because i just compulsory buy shit and that's another huge source of guilt. anyway...&#x200b;i started gigging again but work was much more scarce than the previous year. at the same time, i was working on myself (in retrospect, performing cbt on myself) and came to the conclusion that i needed to drop out of college my senior year (i’d been contemplating it since sophomore year). yes, i could have finished it out, but i came to realize that my major was just a hobby and nothing more, and i didn’t want to waste another year of my life/take on more stress. i’d rather keep my credits and apply them to another major down the line, instead of going through with a major i didn’t want (film, btw).   as i searched myself, i found that carpentry interested me, so after a month or so i found a guy willing to hire me with no experience. now here’s when i really began to feel like i was giving up too easy. it was just some guy and his partner, not much of a company and i was their first employee. i was told we’d be doing mostly carpentry and trim work, but when i arrived it turns out that demo still needed to be done. on the 4th floor of an apartment building. as expected, i took on all the grunt work of sweeping and collecting the trash, doing some light demo where they trusted me to. i must’ve emptied 50 of those 32 gallon trash cans full of sheetrock. it sucked. by the end of the day, my hair was white and i was coughing up dust all night (even with a mask on). at one point the boss had me pulling nails from the wall, and by the end i was pulling up staples from the floor for about an hour. mid-way through the day, i’m sweeping by wire and using it to collect a pile (not wanting to mess with their power tools). the boss sees me doing this and belittles me by saying (\[name\], you gotta lift the wire, buddy” in such a condescending tone it brought me right back to high school. i hadn’t felt so small in years. we worked 9 hours that day. i was beyond exhausted (and dirty).  the next morning, i texted him saying that it was too much and i wasn’t coming back. i never got paid for that day. that showed me enough of his character. throughout the day he had made small remarks like the earlier one, but that one in particular got to me for some reason. it really was the way he said it, like he genuinely believed i was a damn fool. i felt it in my gut right after that i wasn't coming back. i was hired as an apprentice, not a slave. i didn’t learn anything but instead carried out the work they didn’t want to do. i was prepared for hard work, not to be completely used. but i always find myself taken advantage of.  i decided carpentry wasn’t for me, and moved on. i did bits of gigging here and there the next few months. mostly i was trying to find peace within myself. i’ve been incredibly insecure and people-pleasing my whole life, and needed to just take some time to work on myself. i really didn’t know who i was- just some kid who pushed himself way too hard in school to impress people he didn’t like. i got tired of being weak and all that.   last month i decided to look for work again, something simple to get me by while i continue to take time for myself. i decided on the ups personal vehicle driver position, a seasonal job that has you delivering packages from your own car. at $21 an hour and temporary, i was ecstatic. to put a few grand away in only a short months time would be fantastic. well, i thought so, anyway.   after a week or so they scheduled me for a phone interview. they never called. so i rescheduled as i had seen a few posts online about this issue, and rescheduling worked for others. still no call. i finally reached out myself and was interviewed on the spot (by a support technician?) and they told me i got the job and to expect an email with details.   well, i never got that email (or even asked if i accepted the job, actually), and suddenly my location had changed on my profile. there was no building address, but i was due to start that friday. the city was decently far from me (45 mins) and i was really hoping to work in my hometown as the ad stated. not to mention, nobody had informed me of this change. on the wednesday before, i checked the site and had some paperwork to fill out, but still no email. on thursday i called again and the support person told me not to go in the next day as my background check had not passed. it had been about a week and a half, but what else could i do?   the following wednesday i get a call from the same number- asking why i missed my orientation. i told them i had no address and someone from their line told me not to go. they asked for the person's name (as if i would remember?) and told me that my new first day was the next monday, and i’d get an email with details (here we go again).   luckily, i actually did. the location was unfortunately the same, but i was ready for my first day. when i arrived, there was someone else in the same boat- and we were promptly told that there was a disconnect between the support hr and local hr- we were actually supposed to be in a town another 45 minutes away. for some reason, i accepted this and went there. it was the correct location, though the front door was locked and i had to go in through a truck terminal to find an office. once inside, i was greeted by two rude employees who demanded to know why i was bothering them. they set me up with paperwork (about union dues and all that, despite being a contractor and not in the union) and checked out my car- all good. they said i’d be getting a call and email from someone else (seriously?)- and again, i thankfully did. this time it was for training, which consisted of 2.5 hours worth of anything but that- simple safety and policy videos, not how to do the job. i got a call the next morning at 7am about coming in for my first day (???). when i called back, i was met with loud chatter, a loud “what???”, and then put on hold 4 times before the guy who initially called me answered- and then told me to expect a call tomorrow as he was busy. groan.  tomorrow morning came and i got a text- not a call- asking if i wanted to take a route almost 2 hours from my house. i ignored the text as it didn’t seem like it was for me (i had no training or anything). hours later, another text comes from what i thought was an automated line asking me to come in to the branch i was at the first day- i agreed. the man from the phone the day before came out, shoved some papers in my face, asked me to sign one (my soul?) and told me to meet some guy at a location 45 minutes away. by this time i was ready to walk, but decided to hold out until i at least tried the job- maybe it wasn’t bad once i got going. i met the driver and told him i had no training or anything- he told me the basics, gave me a phone with the system, and sent me on my way.  well, the actual job was the easiest fucking part of the process. i almost enjoyed it, except for how far and unfamiliar the route was. the driver assured me that i would likely get a route in my hometown, though, and was only covering for an absence today. it was pretty self-explanatory, so i didn't need training- but it would've been nice. and i got lucky that all went smoothly- had their been an issue, i would've been fucked. the roads were shit, windy, and confusing, half of the houses were missing numbers, but i got it done and i can’t complain about the job itself- like i said, i almost enjoyed it. i had one undeliverable package since the address was mis-labeled on ups’s end, and one other task undone as it was a pick-up, and the driver told me that he’d take care of it.   i head back to the hub (as the driver told me to do, not my actual fucking bosses) and am met with an empty office. i call the number and am told to go to an omv office- i see no such labeled place. i find a room with people in it, go in and ask- it’s the right place. a woman suddenly gets flustered asking why i have a package and where my phone is- i hand over the phone and the package, and before i can explain, start getting grilled. why didn’t you deliver this? why didn’t you finish all your tasks? keep in mind, i don’t know these people and they don’t know me. they don’t know it’s my first day or anything. in fact i have no clue what department this is or what these people are doing here- half are dressed like drivers. once they calm down, i explain and they take care of it- without showing me how to. by the end, some guy pulls me aside and lectures me on the importance of letting ups know when i can’t deliver a package as it’s just as important as the ones that do get delivered- as if i tried to hide the non-delivery or something. once they had their fun with me, i ask for a vest- that’s right, i never even got a vest or a badge, so i was this suspicious kid driving around an unfamiliar neighborhood slowly and delivering packages. the guy comes back with a generic yellow vest, not a ups one, and i go home. again, i felt so small, almost violated. maybe mentally violated. whatever that feeling is, i despise it with every fiber of my being. i’m beginning to love myself and i don’t need that shit, not anymore.   the next day i get the same text- asking me to come in for the same route. i decline and go back to sleep. the day passes.  this morning i receive no text- until about 10am, from some guy named “john” in a group chat asking 10 or so people if we want to work today. i don’t answer, but many do and ask where and when- the response is, verbatim, “here at building at 10:30.” ?????? what building? who the fuck are you? what route? it’s already like 10am? am i expected to wait on a text each morning to let me know if i have work or not?   i ignore the text and carry on with my day.   soon after, i get a text from the bot number (which periodically texts me things about safety and shit) using my name and asking if i want to come in today- it’s already maybe noon. i ignore it again- fuck this.   then maybe an hour later, i receive this text:  “all, you're expected in on monday and working every day, unless there are reasons that you are unavailable from now until christmas unless there are circumstances we are aware of. please confirm that you're working on monday.”  i block the number, shut my phone, and enjoy the rest of my day. i’m done.   and that’s another job i gave up on, day 1. well, day 45 at that point. i just feel like i have more respect for myself than to be treated and tossed around like that. i’m not bending over for these people. i don’t expect to be bowed to, but where’s basic human decency? can i get some basic courtesy from any of these jobs or people? or am i asking too much?   i worked in a sort-of retail job for a little over a year, and a warehouse job for half a year. also the golf job for about a quarter of a year, but i had no intention of quitting when i was let go (damn you covid)- but even there, they never let me know i was let go- i just never heard back. what’s with the lack of human decency? but anyway, having those jobs means at the least i know i can put in the work at shit jobs. i don’t expect a fantastic, perfect job at my age. but i do expect to not be demeaned and belittled. to be treated as incredibly expendable, to not be treated as a human. and i would expect anyone else to have the same respect for themselves. how can you take on this work? i’m so fortunate that i don’t need need it, i’m not desperate enough to accept this bullshit.  i should also mention that i got my first job at 17, working as an office assistant. it was a small lawn and garden place that, again, didn’t train me, and didn’t have much work for me. i was always asking what to do, and usually would get met with “clean” or “just be quiet for a bit.” not long into it, i’m fired for “not doing enough”- which is bullshit when there isn’t work to do. they were hesitant to hire me since they had just hired someone else right before me, and i think they just didn’t need me and didn’t want to tell me. whatever.  this turned into a real shitshow, but so do all of my posts. look, the bottom line is this- after reading my of-course biased story, is it me? am i giving up too easy, or am i just constantly pulling the short straws on jobs? even at the warehouse job, the other employees (again, much older than me) were pretty unfriendly towards me, and i kept to myself. not so much demeaning as these other jobs, but i did also feel small there. the only “decent” job i had was the customer service/retail one, which honestly wouldn’t have been so bad if the work wasn’t. it was the only job i had employees my age and felt kinda welcome. it has its moments of disrespect, but nothing compared to the rest. while i'm at it, i may as well mention that i don't have any friends and miss working with people my age. i really took that job for granted, but i think i was also only 17.  i don’t want to be that guy who puts in 5% and gets back nothing, wondering why. but at the same time, i feel justified in my decisions. of course i didn’t handle them all the best. i could call ups right now and probably straighten it out. but it’s really a principle thing for my since i don’t need the money. and i don’t really think i’m that uptight or picky- i just really think i was majorly disrespected and don’t need to take it.  but is this just how the world is? will i ever be respected at this age? it doesn’t help that i look quite young, too (i’m 21 btw). but it seems that no matter where i go, i get backed into a corner and take the easy way out. i have no issue quitting things- i trust my gut instinct. but when i find it going off for nearly everything i do and try, well, i can’t help but question it. again, i do trust myself and genuinely believe i’ve always been in the right on these decisions. i’m just as deserving as anyone else, why take shit?   i acknowledge that i could have done more and stood up for myself. but should i have to? is the default for employers to just walk all over their employees?  i plan on starting my own business next year- i’m beyond frustrated with the job market. and seriously, i get it. i’m not opposed to hard work. i hate coming on here and essentially just making excuses. like i said, the carpentry job and ups job by themselves were fine- i let the people around me ruin it, because, let’s face it, who you work with determines how the job is. i enjoy an honest days work. that’s why i want to start my own cleaning company- work on my terms, choosing who, where, when, etc. fuck being pushed around and belittled, i have value as a fucking human being, and i’m tired of pretending my whole god-damn life like i don’t. i’m ranting now, but even my grandparents and such make me feel small. what is it about me? is it because i don’t respect and value myself, because honestly i never got a chance to and am just learning how to now.   but i’d really like to hear from you now. how rude of an awakening am i in for out there in the world? the retail general-public experience i have was a spa day compared to how employers have treated me. so, put simply- is it me?",1.0,0.0,1578460638.0,depression

just a post venting about how i struggle with emotional validity,Bend_221,"i just want to get there already. i just want to have everything set up in my life and be content with it all. like have a solid life with a house, wife, kids, and a job. fuck trying to be happy cuz that’s only temporary. happiness will come and go throughout life, so in reality i have no control over what will and won’t bring me happiness. i really just need to be satisfied. but will i ever be truely satisfied? why do i need to be satisfied w my life? i’m gonna die so why pursue satisfaction? maybe i should just enjoy my life. let’s say i just do me though, what do i really want to do?i want to, what i want to donot what everyone else wants me to do, or thinks i should.i keep fucking saying “i” but what about everyone else? the people around me? you are only one compared to millions. you should be more concerned w bettering the greater good. but you can’t do that if you don’t worry about yourself. someone who is broke can’t fix anything. who am i to say anything needs to be fixed in this world anyway? i’m not an all mighty ruler to decide if something is wrong. everyone says things are wrong. who are they to say so? i don’t understand a lot of things. maybe i should try to understand things over my life instead of just having fun? but for what? why understand it, if i’m not going to anything with the information learned? then do something with it then? i could make a living off it. that will get me some food, home etc. but what about my mental? what is going to make you feel satisfied ? that’s the goal here. satisfaction. satisfy as many people as i can including myself. i just don’t know why i need to do that though. why pursue satisfaction if i’m just going to die? like, satisfaction isn’t going to get me anywhere. but it’s better than being unsatisfied with myself as a person and what i’m doing. so the first part of this is realizing why am i unsatisfied w myself rn?  i got a good home, family, and friends? i went to a good school, had a decent childhood, graduated with a advanced diploma, and got into college. but nothing seems that “good”. again, how could i be someone to deem this world, and my life, “good”. if you think about it, good and bad are a construct made by us as humans, just like all of our ideals. but that’s going off on a tangent, we were talking abouuuut my lifeee? yah, is any of the stuff in my life so far been good to me? have i really enjoyed it or just been told to enjoy these things by influential and authoritative figures in my life? man wtf am i even talking about rn though. i wanna know what’s the point of me writing all this right now at 4 in the fucking morning. if you made it this far reading my rambling thoughts, thanks for listening. just remember when you feel alone in your thoughts, that everyone feels alone… so at least we arent alone in that.",1.0,0.0,1634662005.0,depression

i can't find any motivation to do anything. can someone give me some advice?,inFEDEOUS,"first things first, i haven't been officially diagnosed with depression, but based on some of the symptoms i have i still decided to post about my problem on this subreddit. a bit of background: i'm a 20yo male student in my first year of university, and i don't regret choosing this path whatsoever. i don't consider myself ""lazy"": i love what i study and i've always been passionate about learning new things and do what i had to do (in fact i've always had good grades and studying for long periods of time hasn't been an issue in the past). the thing is, lately i haven't been able to find a motivation to apply to anything (let alone studying) in a meaningful manner. i have basically spent the last few months stuck at home (willingly there are no significant covid restrictions on going outside in my country) doing nothing at all, with a crazy sleep schedule and this constant, unavoidable anxiety over my exams and my future. obviously i have to do something about this situation since i have to prepare 3 exams in less than 3 weeks. i tried doing some things that kinda helped me achieve what i'm supposed to do (going to the library, trying to go outside more frequently and so on) but lately i simply haven't been able to bring myself to do anything that could help make this already critical situation better. i don't feel sad or anything, i just feel empty. even if i'm worried about my exams, i just can't do anything about them. i lack motivation and i can't find a reason to do any of this anymore, and i always feel like i just want to lay on my bed and idle forever. i can't even bring myself to go out with my friends when they ask me to. can anyone help me identify what's going on with me? is this just laziness or something more? and do you have any method/advice on how i could solve this issue?thank you so much in advance, i hope this is not some useless garbage thread which has nothing to do with depression/mental illness. sorry for the wall of text too, i feel like i have to give as much context as i can.",1.0,0.0,1503061770.0,depression

understand you'd need to read my biography. but i'll try to provide the basic jist if it all that has me in this position. my 47 years up to this point have been mostly gut punches, failures, lies, and exploitations. i can't trust much as a result including my own jaded outlooks. im literally all alone and isolated mostly by choice if honest after losing so many i loved to death or others addiction. my home thou paid for is falling down i can't afford repairs and it's environment is detrimental and i need out of it, so in away i don't want to invest a thing in it.       i grew up with a very sick mom and eventually dad after her death. he remarried and the new bride stole everything i was supposed to have received including the land my house is on. by law i may can save it but it's took years to legally do which i'm now arriving at.. it requires funds i can't get. due to other past mistakes and exploitations that i allowed .   before mom died i got married in away to let her have peace more than for my future. i'd even thought of divorce upon her death. i never actually wanted to get married have kids etc. well after mom died in just a couple months my daughter was concieved. i was a emotional wreck i took it as something it wasn't and tried to make it work with a woman who'd become dependant on me and refused to help instead become a addict a thief and made everything worse but not before a second pregnancy with my son. i eventually threw her out kept kids for 3 years untill she got sober. then i allowed her to get them i had no one to help me i lost job after job because they kept getting sick and i'd have to stay home as daycares or schools wouldn't keep them so i could work. doing so allowed me i thought to at least help provide ex never has worked since births. so i chose no state order to give a check a month to help care for them. i wanted to leave this state but can't as i feel i'd abandon them so i sought away to stay i had a house but not stable income. to get that i went back to work for my bro in laws company that i started with but had to leave when mom died as sister went crazy and legal actions had to be taken to protect my father. i literally was leaving after sitting here jobless carless for 6 months with fries ends headed out west when told that morning they'd pit me to work. thou i was paid less than i had been in 15 years doing my trade..this was about 5 yrs ago now. since i've gotten back to what i was paid and if honest in many ways have it made. yet i know people i've trained have been placed in positions over me. several make more than me thou non have my decades of experience i never miss a day. my only vice is cigarettes. financially i can survive but i can't save not is a second job much of a option as hours vary widely in my primary job. as a result i sit at home on weekends knowing i need to be doing but have no motivation to do. i have 20 yrs left to work i have zero retirement i have a failing home structurally i have legal fights i have to fund to get anything i should have been given,   that prevents me from leaving the failing home or the state takes the property.  i can't leave nor can i see away to increase pay that i shouldn't be having to even ask for from a bro in law that has no alliegence to me as my sister is dead and he's a widow with millions thanks to what we started  im just lost i'm stuck i couldn't survive if i had rent or mortgage to pay. i can't leave or state takes my land. i can't find away to raise the funds and hold some sense of dignity when literally 10k would solve and provide me with assets i should already hold. a raise isn't likely as i'm told it'll get better i have a future that never seems to arrive at the hands of the one i helped get rich that lives across the driveway and sees daily my struggles. now's i live in a house that roof leaks no heat no ac. electricity out in half the home even. i can't afford to repair or to leave . i won't bring my kids here to stay the night even i'm embarrassed.   now that's just a tip of the iceberg but how can i find hope that in another 20 years i won't be dependant on the state likely living in govt housing and a monthly ssi check. it's either i fix these issues post haste or i won't have time to prevent it. and it my future us only getting older sicker likely living in that state barely surviving still if i can as medical cost will likely increase. do i just ghost out and try to build elsewhere which odds seem against being successful and to do so means i leave it all land to state, kids to ex, stability thou not compensated adequately ,for a chance that could literally leave me homeless and worse off and even more alone. or just accept this is my existence suffering is my best friend i'm only supposed to eat once a day. i'm supposed to be living as i do in squalor am i supposed to have no pride i myself or hope in what i can achieve. and if this is what i'm supposed to accept then why exist at all. why only suffer till i die in ever increasing ways when it's already this bad. is life worth living without hope joy self respect love if self and others and relationships with others that are seemingly exploitive of what you can do for them. what is life if to weak and powerless to live and make changes required when needed.. it can only condemn the existence to come afterall  so why wait why experience that. i think i seriously need mental health attn. but would i if i could alter some external situations to my benefit. i don't think so i just desperately need a win. i've had nothing but loses for almost two decades now. both parents ally siblings my two longest life friends my wife, my inheritance if half a million and home land etc. career being stalled by those that i trusted to help me have a better future so i could be in my kids lives in a manor that didn't destroy my self worth. i'm just not seeing the fight to live as worth

my life just turned around,CrookedLadyM,"hey yall; i have to share this with someone-i have been suffering and fighting and losing to depression for as long as i can remember. i lived in an abusive environment, like many people that exist these days.education was a huge source of pride for me throughout my life. i was really active in the school curriculum. i didn't hate other kids but i had this weird sinking feeling whenever people looked at me, my mind would blank, and my heart would start beating. so i was awkward of course and only had a couple friends. learning though--- that was what i went for. i loved school. it was better than home. during the summer of 9th grade, i went to my friends home in the town over for a week. another story made short- my mother had left and moved out of the city while i was away. she f***ing abandoned me. my stupid as* told the school and they said i needed an address to attend. so i found an address- then they said i needed a guardian- couldn't find one of those- and my friends dad was not in a traveling condition being a paralyzed man. so that didn't work- they said try when you're 16 so i started tracking that b**** and got emancipated (she moved to the other town by the city) -i was 16 at this point anyways. then guess what?? they said i was too old.because i was on welfare at the time, they told me to try alternative education- so i went and worked my ass off to catch up to everyone else and then circumstances changed again. the small school closed. i gave up on myself completely. school was a source of pride for me and the depression sunk in. at this point i was 'living' with an abusive boyfriend. (that's how it always goes right)that was 12 years ago and having been heart broken since. (also literally ran away from that guy with my cat hahaha (who i still have :3))my life had been a complete mess.these past few years have been really hard. my mother died from alcoholism, then my stepfather died 3 years later from lung cancer. my brother overdosed and died. my friend had a baby, and i'm happy for her, over the moon! but i have no one anymore.i held pride in being an educated kid and when i lost that chance, i would attack myself for not being better than i am. why do i suck so much? i couldn't even finish school! i'll never measure up to who i dreamed of being.so i am working a monotonous job that i lied to about having high-school-like everyone else-, every single day and give up. i attempted to ride the sewer slide and failed at that too. because at this point i had a cat and a good boyfriend. damn life lines.but i still needed my life to end somehow. so i said eff it one day and applied for college. it was the weirdest and biggest and scariest decision i ever made. ever. i just dont do that kind of thing.yesterday i got my highschool transcripts back. so obviously i checked them. and checked them. and googled everything i could think of to combat what i'm f***ing looking atreddit. i did it. i did it, i got my diploma. i got it when i was 17, before the school closed. reddit. all i want to do is scream in joy and humility~i have beaten myself up for many things and school was one of them. every interview, everytime someone brought up high-school, everytime i reminisced on projects~ i was proud of myself then~and i haven't felt this way since- and i did it without hergood riddance!!!! depression will sink in again, but atleast by then i'll be in school, or doing a job i feel worth being there for.thank for anyone who read. i haven't been this happy in a long, long time. i could live here in this feeling forever, and even i cant- right now it's worth it.tl;dr: i got my mother fu**ing  high-school diploma bish-nut!!!!!!!!",5.0,2.0,1605814748.0,depression

(there was an altercation that happened a couple months back that ended it for me) i no longer want anything from my father. thank you for letting me vent. and please dont tell me you should try and find your own place i am highly aware of this. good luck to all of you out there suffering keep pushing through.",3.0,1.0,1629294764.0,depression

need advice on ex who is depressed,cashmereonly888,"me and my ex dating for 2.5 years and then one night he went crazy and checked himself into a mental hospital. after he got released from the hospital he sent me a text breaking up with me. it’s been a couple of months since the break up text and we have spoken periodically. he says that he can’t be with me because he is depressed, he will only bring me down and that i should move on. this all happened so suddenly because i never saw this coming nor had any idea he struggled with suicidal thoughts. he was diagnosed with clinical depression and intermittent anger disorder and has constant suicidal thoughts. he is going to therapy twice a week and is currently on medication. after some conversations he says that he doesn’t regret the break up, that he loves me and that even if he gets better he probably will want to still be alone. he’s also going out a lot, hanging with friends, drinking, and talking to other women. he’s been honest with me. right now i am his “friend” (his request), but i love him and hope that we can find our way back together. we’ve hooked up a couple of times and still talk here and there as i am the only person who truly knows and understands him. do you think he will ever want to get back together? should i move on or stay in his life, supporting him as friend in hopes that we might be able to get back together? i know that this won’t happen over night, but i can’t let him go nor can i help but hope we can get back together. i’m willing to wait but am i wasting my time?",2.0,0.0,1638638378.0,depression

my dad hanged himself,Independent-Result54,sorry for my english im an 17 year old european im trying... this might be a long post but i would like advice from you guys or people with experience and i need to get this off my chest since i dont have alot of people i can really talk to because im lost.. about half a year ago my father found a new wife since my parents were divorced. at that time before he married he would ask me would u still talk to me if i found a new wife? at first i was like nah are u out of your mind u aint marrying. but later i was like aslong as its a good wife and makes you happy but i dont wanna get to know her. so he married her and since he married her he didnt spend asmuch time with me he didnt call me asmuch he used to help me with my books and shit financially before i started working he stopped doing all this. his wife didnt want him spending time.and shit with me. at that time i was angry at him so i stopped talking with him for  awhile and he said he would make a new kid with her a kid that would listen to him i was like whatever but this wasnt the first time we stopped talking to each other. we always beef then we make it good again. so we made it good again but about 3 weeks ago i stopped talking to him well i talked to him but i didnt answer his calls asmuch i didnt spend asmuch time with him as i used to not like i spend time with him alot before but less... either way i told him to not call me because he only comes to me or calls.me if he feels like it. i was just angry just because he calls me or comes to me once a week or once in the 2 weeks if he wants to. what kind of dad chooses his wife over his son and whenever you beef with your wife you get back to your son. anyway thats how i felt maybe it wasnt like that maybe he had his own problems clearly. 1 week passed away i was working at a late saturday my father came to my work randomly i wasnt expecting him.. he asked my colleagues if i was working and they said yeah he told them if they could bring me to him that he needed to talk to me privately. so my colleagues come to me tell me my dad is here i go to my dad and i tell him im working this isnt the time to talk right now and he smiles at me and is like alright ill wait for you outside tell me when you finished. so he goes outside i finish my work he waits about an hour for me and when i finished my work i straight up took my bike and ride away with it towards my house. he went after me with his car and honked a couple times to me but i ignored him then he called me and was like we need to talk we cant be like this but i told him to go home and leave me alone. on my way home i saw my 2 cousins i went with them to buy some shit at the supermarket and i think my dad saw me too and he went home dissapointed. the next sunday he calls me about 10 or 15 times i dont answer. the next day.... monday i was working out from 14:00 till like 16:00 he calls me alot again like usual but around 14:30 he messaged me son take good care of ur family and sister be a father i love you but i didnt read it at first else i wouldve called him instantly or go to his house... when i finished working out i went home and my cousin called me. she never calls in 17 years this was the first time i was like what the.... so i call her im like wassup... she tells me to call my other cousin its something about your father... so i was scared i thought it was something with his lungs or heart since he smokes alot of cigarettes so i call the other cousin (her brother) but before i called him i read those messages and i already had some feelings so i call him and he tells me if i am alone im like yeah why whats wrong he tells me to sit and get a glass of water at that moment i knew... then he told me ur father died he hanged himself i didnt believe it why the fuck would he do that i thought he was kidding i thought it was a plan my dad made up so i would talk with him again. but it wasnt... so after i heard that i instantly called my mom and sister i told them to come home instantly it was important i didnt tell them on phone i was scared something would happen while driving home... so they come home i tell them what happened they didnt believe it either but it was true. later that day we went to his house. whenever someone commits suicide detectives have to research if the suicide was out of the persons own will or if the suicide was forced by somebody or whatever. so they didnt let us in and my father lived in like a flat where u have 1 small door at the bottom and if that door is open u could go up to his room. but the detectives didnt let us in they said we had to wait for the research to be done but i was i was stresses and wanted to see my dad so i broke that door and i went upstairs to see my dad but the officer took me outside handcuffed me for 10 mins and cooled me down and let me go so we waited outside for the research to be done. and we saw a few neighbours walk by while we were crying they knew someone comit suicide because of the police and detectives. so this one old woman came to us and told us that she was my dads neighbour. she told us my father was a good man always happy but he always beefed with his wife everyday. she said his wife was never good to him and the day before todat (sunday) his wife hit him outside while they were argueing apparently they always beefed but the neighbour said my dad never layed a finger on her. that my dad is a good man but the wife killed him and it wasnt just her 2 or 3 neighbours said the same thing. so about an hour passed away i went outside to get some fresh air but while i was outside my dads new wife came in. i wasnt in there but my mom and sister were still waiting for the detectives to come. so his new wife came in and was straight up talking shit. she was like how did this happen... omg... my mom was like yeah we should ask you that question since you live with him. she was like yeah when his son and daughter dont answer the phone he would go mad.. so she tried to blame me and my sister from what i heard. i come in and i wait with my dad and sister i see her looking nasty at me im like the fuck you looking at she is like nothing. so my sister tells me the story about how she is blaming me and my sister. i told her what the neighbours told us and told her if she would talk wack one more time about my sister i would kill her she got all red and apologized either way fuck that bitch. so we waited about 2 hours and they came downstairs told us that my father hanged himself out of own will and it wasnt forced suicide. they told us if we wanted to we could go inside and see the body. so we went inside they told us he was in the right room. i go in the room first i see my dads body laying there in the bed his eyes closed i see the strains around his neck from the rope his body was so cold i couldnt believe it i kissed him i didnt wanna let him go but my mom pulled me away then i his wife came in you could litteraly see her fake crying it was so obvious... fuck man so we wait for the people to pick the body up and bring him to the mosque since in our culture you gotta wash the body and in 3 days he gotta be burried. so while we wait my cousin comes in brings me my dads stuff as memorial. hes a good guy honestly he is the only guy that has ever been there for my father when he needed him and to be honest he been there more for my father then myself probably. so while we wait i ask my cousin what happened the told me my father was fine he didnt seem depressed or stresses at all in the morning he told him to give this.money to me since i didnt talk to my father he gave him a rack for my driver lessons since he wanted to help me. so my cousin was like alright will do so my dad and his new wife beefed again at work that day thats why he was home so early. so he messages me with i love u take good care and messages his new wife and his sister so my dads sister read it at first and got scared and called my cousin (her son) to take a look at his house to see wassup. so my cousin tells me he went to his house but nobody opened so he called and messaged him he didnt answer so he calls the neighbours and tells them he is afraid something happened and asked of they could.open their door so he could climb trough their balcony to my dads house. so he did that and when he opened the door he saw my dad on the wall... he saw the body and the rope and fainted at first. he called the police after that then he called me and thats how it happened.  yeah so he told.me what happened and we waited for them to pick the body up. and while we were waiting his new wife started talking about money and said they always put money on this table that someone stole it. like we give a fuck about money.... like what... my father dies and she thinks about money... i mean its obvious she never loved him she litteraly only.married him so she could have an european passport since she lived on turkey... struggled there and met my father and used his money... either way fuck her so they took the body next day we washed him he went to turkey and we burried him there. thats pretty much what happened.i feel bad i blame myself for him comitting suicide. if i knew he would have had this much stress and depression because of his wife or life i wouldve even lived with him but i didnt know i ran away from him i avoided him like an idiot child... everyday i live with regret and it doesnt go away whenever i think its getting better i think about it again. he would always tell me to go therapy he would always tell me that he is my father he would never want anything bad happen to me he would want the best for me. i didnt take him serious. sadest thing is he never went to therapy himself while he told me to go.i shouldve went to therapy together with him if i only knew damn man fuck me... but on the other side this isnt the first time that i beefed with him and didnt answer his calls my brother also passed away 3 years ago because of an mental ilness and my dad kept going in life he marries 6.months with some random and this happens... my father and mother were married 30 years and beefed every week and nothin happened i dont know why he would do this all i know is i havent been there enough for him. whenever he would tell me to come to his house to hangout or outside to a bar to chill or whatever id always say no no no id chill with my own fake ass friends smoking weed and beeing a junky instead of chilling with the actual guy that need help and

question about dopamine reuptake inhibitors,Jimmy_Popkins,"i have this weird phenomenon that whenever i experience a release of dopamine, be it through an orgasm, drinking or weed, i feel fine for half a day, but then my motivation and mood plummet for at least 24 hrs. stuck in brain fog. my speech is noticeably worse (limited vocabulary, quieter, etc.).it can take between 3-5 days for me to feel leveled out again. i hardly ever drink, and i quit weed years ago. the orgasms though… that’s just a cruel neurotransmitter game my brain is playing on me.i’d love to understand the mechanism with my dopamine release. it doesn’t get released when i work on projects that used to make me feel good (and still would if i didn’t procrastinate them). instead i go for the dopamine rush and as a consequence need 3-5 days to be back at baseline.this year my psychiatrist put me on sertraline (an ssri). it was supposed to help with social anxiety, lower cortisol / prolactin and give me the motivation to work of an ever-growing stack of projects i’ve been procrastinating. but sertraline took away any remaining motivation and made me bed-ridden for the entire summer, even on the lowest dose. i slowly quit it after 8 weeks and experienced all the negative symptoms from brain zaps to upset stomach to increased sweating. i’ve tried other ssris over the past 15 years but none seemed to benefit me, and all gave me side effects.should i give wellbutrin (bupropion) a try? i used it twice over the past two decades but no longer have records on why i quit them. i recall not having sexual side effects on it, but perhaps it made me more irritable / anxious. is there perhaps another medication that is more geared on dopamine reuptake inhibition and less so on norepinephrine? my social anxiety and general high-stress exhaustion would probably go into overdrive if i keep more norepinephrine in my system.",2.0,1.0,1575292253.0,depression

i came to a realisation tonight.,Captain-Ashby,"this will be a bit of a longer post, as i need to get my thoughts out. sorry in advance if it breaks any rules.so for context i moved out of my parents home a year ago, to a capital city that my best friend lived in. i love my family but i needed my own space and to be around people that i chose to be around for them, not just their proximity.however, somewhere along the line, i started making dumb decisions. my friend, god bless her soul, invited me into her friend group here, and i got along with everyone great, and they accepted me as one of their own. problem is i work a full time job from home and they were all uni students in their last year, and i had no other social life. schedules never lined up and i never had any life events in common with them, so more and more i found that as everyone had to commit to their studies, i was at home, alone, for weeks on end, with no one to talk to aside from work colleagues. i haven’t been in a relationship in years, and have made no real attempt to fix that.i started spiralling, and towards the end of this last term, i essentially went 6 months where i only saw my friends a couple of times. i also have been struggling with job satisfaction, and a lack of hobbies, and generally just slowly losing my personality. i tried therapy around the middle of the year. it helped for a short while, but i ultimately gave it up.i think the worst part is me and my friend started arguing more and more as the year progressed, when we never had before (this really hurt me, as i knew i was fucking up but didn’t know how, or how to stop, and i hated myself for making their life harder). i never knew what to talk about when we hung out, and i will never understand why she kept putting up with my boring ass when we stopped clicking. this was the one person i’ve always trusted with anything, and i was fucking it up.now i’ve never been suicidal, as i’m shit-scared of what may come after, but recently i found myself constantly wondering how much better everyone’s lives would’ve been if i never moved here. how i could just start walking one day, and that no-one in my life would know until work realised i wasn’t working. how much fun everyone would have if i wasn’t putting a damper on things.it all culminated in the last couple of weeks. i finally had a chance to start hanging with my friends again, but each chance i fucked up somehow. the first, i just tried to hang with just my friend, but for her own valid and personal reasons, she wanted to invite others, first from our friend group, then just her bf (who for the record i get along great with). i declined both times because i didn’t have the energy to deal with more than one person. this led to a misunderstanding over whether i had an issue with their relationship, which was so far from the case i didn’t know how to react.then we hung out the next weekend with one other friend, after talking things out, and it went great. but then we made plans to hang out the following week, and i again fucked it up by assuming her valid reason for maybe postponing our hangout was because she was politely wanting to not hang. again we talked it out, and hung out. but it ended on a weird note, and i spiralled for the next fortnight, barely eating or sleeping.then today happened. there was a party where our group and like two other groups were all going to hang out at a park for christmas. i bowed out, claiming overexhaustion and a headache (which was true but exaggerated), when my real reason was i didn’t know how to react going from no interaction to a 30 people party without being depressing, despite it being my chance to finally see everyone again. my friend again commented that it sucked that i was missing out on a chance to be happy.i made myself have dinner, and fell asleep watching youtube on the couch. when i woke up, it was like a switch was flipped. my friend was right to be confused. “why did i make an excuse not to see everyone, when that’s what i wanted more than anything?”. and i realised that i’ve been my own worst enemy, sabotaging any chance at my own happiness, and bringing everyone else down as a result. i sent apologies to my friends, confessing my dumbness, and am yet to hear back (which is fair given it’s the middle of the night).so i guess now i need to figure out how to be happy again, how to be someone worth being friends with. i want to be better so bad. i don’t know what i’ll do if i fuck it up again. but how?",1.0,0.0,1572958758.0,depression

no reason to be depressed,Pinkcargopants,"i have been depressed before and have had all the logical reasons to have been. i used to mess my brain up with all kinds of drugs and i was in a very toxic relationship filled with all kinds of abuse. the drugs fueled my derealization and my visual snow which didn't go well with the depression. i eventually reached out for help and my parents and myself, with the help of therapy and mostly medication, got me rid of depression. now almost one year off the medication i yesterday got a random feeling similar to back then, except without the derealization part. i'm trying to stay calm since i really think that the feeling will be gone within a week. and i know this sounds a little weird since everyone gets sad every once in a while, i do too, but this doesn't feel like that, it feels almost exactly like the depression from back then. i have done almost everything to stay sane recently and everything in my life seems good. i have a girlfriend who i love and who treats me well. i have been working out every monday, wednesday, and friday consistently to keep my stress levels down and it helps my overall mental state as well. school and its studying have never gone better and i have routines that i rarely ever break. so how does this happen? has anyone felt this random mood shift in a quite perfect time of your life? could there be a reason for it or is it totally random? how would the brain slowing the production of them happy chemicals have any benefit for me? if anyone wants to share any similar experiences or if anyone has any answers to my question i'd be happy to listen.much luv from a randomly depressed dude <3",2.0,0.0,1606807846.0,depression

my only goal in life is to ghost everyone.,futzingaround,"back in the summer of 2018, my uncle randomly called out of the blue to inform me his wife had passed away not too long ago. the both of them had been a pretty big presence in my pre-teen years, taking me under their roof when my dad couldn't keep himself together. so, he called to talk to me the first time in years and asked if i'd care to fly down to florida for a reunion and funeral service. of course, i said yes. because it wouldn't have been so bad to see family that i didn't inherently associate with my childhood traumas. however, i am and always have been a reclusive basement-dwelling nobody. no car, no job, no money, no state id. no real will to live.this caused a few hiccups, obviously. couldn't really book a flight from md to fl and board it without any id. i told him as much and he went out of his way to send me $60 to help me with the process of obtaining an id so he could then book my flight. this was in early august of that summer. come september, i had spent forty of the sixty dollars on marijuana in order to self-medicate the depression away and told myself i'd use the other twenty to get my id. tried to do some of the necessary steps by mail, only to learn that md no longer allowed certain things to be sent by mail. like a new social security card. so, of course, my depressed ass said screw it and just stopped trying altogether. stopped worrying about it, stopped talking to my mom about it, stopped answering his calls.at the time, i didn't have a phone or working number or any sort of sleep schedule so he was only able to reach me through the home phone, which my step-grandmother pretty much handles herself, from the hours of like midnight to three a.m. this eventually caused a fight between her and my uncle because he kept calling and i kept dodging his calls, and in response, she blocked him. october then rolled around and i received the news via other family members that he had been admitted to the hospital, which prompted me to call him myself and finally talk to him. he assured me everything was fine and that it was nothing serious. and i fed him a whole bunch of bullshit as to why i was never really around to take his calls. still, he persisted on the idea of getting me to florida and i agreed, stringing him along on some more bullshit.that conversation happened around the end of october. november came and i sat on my ass, just daydreaming about dying. doing nothing to make it down to florida. then december came and nearly passed, and it was the day after christmas that i received the news that my uncle had passed away. the same year as his wife because it turned out he was sick and wasn't improving. so, essentially, i ghosted my uncle for nearly half a year until he, himself, became a ghost. and now this entire year of 2021 all i've been hoping and praying for ( after a third failed attempt ) is that maybe i'll die the day after christmas, too, due to health complications i've been keeping from my immediate family. it's literally all i want for christmas. the simple gift of no longer existing would be the best thing to ever happen to me. and every day i hate the fact that i even lived this long. i just want to be the corpse i feel like i am most days.",8.0,1.0,1476082938.0,depression

(tw: sexual assault)&#x200b;we met when i was 16 and he was 15 towards the end of 2020. i had just shifted apartments and was in a terrible place mentally. i had cut all my friends off and was very depressed and suicidal. he shifted to the same apartment a few months later and we met through a mutual friend. i find it very hard to connect with people so when we hit it off immediately it felt amazing.  i wasn’t looking for anything romantic with him initially because he was younger than me and i wasn’t keen on the idea, but we quickly became best friends and knew that we started liking each other. i was very against dating because because i felt like i wasn’t emotionally ready and he said he was too. we started kissing and making out and soon after admitted that we had feelings for each other on call one night. he asked me why we aren’t dating and i told him that it wouldn’t end well, and that the idea just icks me out a little. but he kept being like why not, and to have some faith, so i agreed. mind you, i really liked him at this point so i was willing to give it a shot. &#x200b;i’d never gone past 2nd base before and he’d already had sex so it wasn’t as much of a big deal to him. before we started dating i gave him head which i guess gave him the get go that i was ready to do anything. since we lived in the same apartment we met everyday, and after that day he would kind of expect it everyday even when i just wanted to kiss. i was a little surprised at the beginning but i thought it was normal and i didn’t want to disappoint so i went ahead with it. he’d also constantly turn every conversation we had, especially late at night, into something sexual even when i made it clear that i was uncomfortable. i’d give in every time because i didn’t want him to think i didn’t like him, and tried to convince myself that it was just because he liked me. &#x200b;i should’ve realised then that he wasn’t educated about consent, but i was so blinded by how much i liked him and how good it felt to have someone with you 24/7 that i told myself that these were all normal things to expect in a relationship. i had an abusive childhood too so love seemed different to me than what it may be for others. i told him i wanted to wait and that i wanted my first time to be special, be it with him or not. he said yes absolutely and many things which made me trust him further, although his actions showed otherwise. &#x200b;my friend(16f at the time) was groomed by another guy in our friend group(19m at the time) into hooking up straight after her break up. he knew that she was a virgin and that she expected only making out, maybe 3rd base max but penetrated her without asking for her consent. it happened in the washroom of a common building in our apartment and soon after she told our friend group. him and i talked about how horrible it was, and he said that it was awful and how disgusting it was for him to do something like that. i was glad he felt that way. not even a week later, he takes me to the same washroom.&#x200b;we were looking at his old childhood pictures before that, and laughing together. it was a nice night. he told me that he had to go home soon and to go to the washroom with him. i thought making out can’t hurt and went with him. we kissed, and before i knew it he had taken mine and his clothes off. all i remember is everything moving super fast. i was on top of him kissing him when i felt that he was trying to penetrate me. i told him that i’m scared and that i wasn’t sure, but i thought it must’ve been a mistake because we’d already talked about it. and he himself had said that he didn’t want me to lose my virginity to some quickie in a dark washroom. he didn’t ask me if i wanted to. before i knew it he was inside me. i just remember feeling completely numb. my mind was frozen in some sort of icy shock. screaming what the fuck is going on what the fuck is happening. i didn’t make a single sound. i didn’t say no. i let him continue. i just wanted it to be over with. towards the end pushed me off him and shoved my head down again. i resisted by lifting my head up once, but once he pushed again i gave in. &#x200b;he got up and handed me my clothes and started dressing himself. i still remember exactly what he was wearing, what i was wearing, the feeling of clutching my clothes to my chest in that dark dingy washroom. i couldn’t speak. he realised something was wrong when i couldn’t speak. he helped me get dressed and kissed me on the forehead and asked are you ok? i didn’t say anything except push him away. i could tell that he was getting scared. what’s wrong he kept asking, over and over and over. whatever i tried to speak came out in whispers. i didn’t realise i was whispering until i saw him lean closer and closer to catch what i was trying to say. he kept trying to hold my hand. i was so heartbroken. i trusted him so much. i felt so dirty and disgusting and violated. i felt like the one thing that was truly mine in this world had been taken away from me for 5 minutes of someone’s gratification. i dropped him home.&#x200b;i was so confused. what had just happened? i called my younger sister(15m) before he got into the lift when i realised my voice hadn’t come back so he took the phone from me and told her that he thinks he made me sad. he went home. my sister and i aren’t close but we have this kinship in the fact we’ve been through the same things together. that was the first time i hugged her in my life. i sobbed until i was sore, and she did too. i told her what had happened. i didn’t feel like myself anymore. it felt like the last, hopeful, part of me had been ripped away. like my heart had been ripped away from my chest, beating and bloody till it eventually stopped. i told him not to tell anyone. he messaged me saying he’s such a terrible boyfriend and that he is so sorry and that i should stab him if it makes me feel better. i scrubbed myself raw in the shower that night for what felt like hours trying the get the memory out of my skin. &#x200b;i’m going to spare you the details now. but after this i broke up with him after a couple days, he insisted that we should still be friends. i didn’t want to lose him. losing him at the same time this happened would’ve felt like 2 tragedies at once. we started dating again barely a month later. i wished that he would leave because i didn’t have the strength to. i had no space to myself. he told me he understood that what he did was wrong and that he loved me. when i asked him how could someone who loves someone else rape them he said he thought i wanted to. and that he thought i said i was scared and i don’t know because i thought someone was outside. i comforted him because he felt bad about raping me.&#x200b;he told me he’d get panic attacks when i talked about it which made me stop because i didn’t want to make him uncomfortable. then he’d ask me why i don’t talk to him ab it. i was the only one who believed him when he said it was an accident, a mistake. deep down i knew it wasn’t of course, like everyone else, but i was so blinded by the temporary comfort being with him provided that it just didn’t matter. i wanted comfort from the person who caused the pain. i was so lost.&#x200b;it was still very rocky with intense highs, and much more intense lows. but the highs were so addictive. he’d get mad when anyone suggested that our relationship was toxic. we were on and off because my friends knew about what happened and made me break up with him, but i always went back. i slept with him again too. he still pressured me but this time i told myself i’m doing it because i wanted to. there was one day when i was sobbing thinking about it in front of him and he just smiled and told me to hit him. to get it out. he kept trying to rile me up. i didn’t want to hit him, i just wanted to cry in his arms. him smiling in that sick way did something though, and it felt like a fog had been lifted. i told my friends in the apartment and they begged him to leave me alone. he said if she wants me to i will. i knew that he’d leave me once he loves me if ever and that i’d leave once i love myself. being with him after was some kind of self-punishment. he knew about my problems at homes, and with my mental health, i’d never, ever been so exposed and vulnerable to a single person in my life. the one time they ask me to trust them and i do it ends up like this. &#x200b;anyways, we don’t break up but his parents find out that we’re together and being quite conservative, lash out. i finally got some space from him. no contact whatsoever, and i realised that i had to break up w him. i texted him that we need to go on a break and soon after that we need to break up. he asked to meet irl just to say goodbye. i wanted to see him one last time and still somehow hoped that we’d be on good terms. we talked to 2mins and then he kept trying to take my mask off (pandemic), i let him and we pecked. like a goodbye, thanks for the memories peck. i must seem very stupid and i was, but i’d give anything to get that naivety back. after that, he kept trying to makeout with me and touch me. i didn’t freeze this time. i said no, and i pushed him. multiple times. i said stop and put my hand between us. moved myself away, told him to please sit down. he kept going. it finally dawned on me that he was never sorry and that he’d never understand. that i can’t put myself in harms way to protect other people and make him learn, because he never will. he pushed me tried to force me to go down on him and i screamed fuck off which was when it finally hit him i guess. he sat next to me. i didn’t know what to say. &#x200b;he didn’t say anything either. he fell to my feet after a while and started sobbing about how he didn’t know what was wrong with him, and that i deserve better and to please forgive him. i lost my voice again. i made him promise me that he’d never hurt another girl in his life, although the promise probably means nothing. i went home. my friends mom found out and was going to tell his and i, stupidly again, told him to tell them himself because it would be better if they heard it from his mouth. i didn’t want him to get punished i just wanted him not to do it again. he told them only about the recent time because apparently they would’ve blame me otherwise. he was still trying to convince me that he was looking out for me. i asked to speak to his mom and he refused. i asked him to tell them about the first time and he said i’m sorry, i love you but this is the most i can do for you. i can’t ruin a life long relationship with my parents. &#x200b;i told my dad soon after. it broke him. he’s abusive, but i know at the end of the day, he does want what’s best for me. he asked me what i wanted to do and if i wanted to go to the police. after i told him the whole story, he essentially blamed me for going back to him. and that if i was really so disgusted with the first time why would i go alone with him afterwards. i didn’t know how to explain. hopefully, i’ll be able to tell my therapist and she’ll explain it to him in a way he’ll understand. &#x200b;i still miss him. i know it wasn’t real but i miss him so much. i don’t know how i’ll ever be normal again. i feel so unlike myself and broken. &#x200b;thank you for reading, i’d

please help me… i am so lost,throwaway_syngonium,"i dont even know where to start all of this, now when i decided to write it all down my mind is completely blank, i am so sick of even existing. i am not suicidal nor do i plan to kill myself, i still have slight hope in myself that there is a reason for this happening and that me understanding why is just around the corner. that is what keeps me going, i guess. or i became so miserable that i have no energy to even kill myself. i dont even know. i know nothing. right now i am laying on the couch, 27, in a country of which i do not even know the language nor one living soul here. why? because my boyfriend made me prove his loyalty to him and i was ready to do absolutely anything to be like this for him, and of course, expecting the same in return. but i never got it in return. and i just want to know why? i have no family, my parents broke off contact with me 2 months ago when i wqs begging them for financial support just so i could have for my basic needs and wants and they did not want to help me. i grew up with a narcissist mother and very violent father, i have lived with my parents until 25 because at that point my mother manipulated me to the extent where i thought that this is all i deserve from life, being home, with my parents, every atom of me being controlled, not allowed to go out with certain friends because i was threatened that they gonna kick me out if i do. my father beat me physically until i was 17/18 to the point of such soreness that i could not walk for days at a time. but it was all i had, few times i tried to tell to my grandparents about it and i got kicked out from my parents house. my grandparents gave me a car - my parents sold it and took money for themselves, threatened me if i say anything to my grandparents that i will be kicked out. i did not hear “i love you” from them since i was 8. constantly making fun of me, of my weight, of how i look, of my hair on “unfeminine parts” of me, pimples, everything. i remember when i got my first period and i was so scared to tell it to my mother so i have stole her tampons, she noticed, forced me to strip naked in front of her and beat the shit out of me because i did not tell her that i got my first period. they used to lock me up in my room for hours everyday, go out and return home 30mins before my school started and let me out of my room to go get ready. i dont even remember 90% of my life because i forced myself to forgot. when i was 17 i got my first boyfriend, the first person that i liked and felt something for (just a highschool love, looking back now its funny) which with who i stayed for a year and a half, he cheated on me multiple times, called me in the middle of the night how he fucked some girl that lives 500km away from us because i did not want to fuck with him, and how it is my fault, how i am ugly and disgusting and that he had no choice but to cheat on me. foolish of me for even staying a milisecond with him, but i never had any self respect based on what i had with my parents my whole life, i thought once again i deserve this. friends always used me up for money (my grandma was giving me money for getting as at school) and it was my only way of keeping friends. they knew it, i knew it. fast forward to being 25. i have met such a wonderful guy online, it felt surreal, it felt like my patience and suffering has finally paid off and i got over it, i thought this was my reward for everything bad that ever happened. and what happened? i became obsessed with him, with his existence, with everything that he was saying that he was. he was all i ever wanted, at least presented himself as that. i was a virgin, he was a virgin too - which was very important to me, because i grew up in a household where my parents were first to each other and have spent their lives together, i was blamed to be a whore everytime i would hang out with my male colleagues from school or from neighborhood and i developed a fear of doing anything with man that i do not plan to spend my whole life with. and my ex cheating only intensified the importance of this to me. and i was so happy, finally someone who is the same as me on that topic. it took me 4 months to meet that man, i was terrified of any sort of rejection, i was terrified of my stretch marks, of my saggy boobs, of pimples - who looks like that at the age of 25? its a disgrace. i never in my life felt feminine or wanted. but he accepted me, we started dating, everything was going good until we moved in last year november. since then i have found out that he has, or had, i dont know what is true anymore, a serious porn addiction while talking with me, looking me in the eyes and for months telling me how disgusting and degrading it is, skipping every half naked scene of the movie because “he does not want to see that”, i told him many times without even knowing he has addiction that i would not mind if my boyfriend watched porn - and yet he still lied to me months and months and months on going about it. admitted that he was watching it at work and jerking off to it (spending all of his megabytes on the phone on it and because of that wasnt able to talk with me because no internet), how he watched it at home while i was in bed. we had sex everyday multiple times and did everything that was wanted and needed. today i found on his old phone a whole bookmarks category with folders called - new tier 1, tier 1, tier 2, tier 3 full of different pornstars, folder with skinny girls, folder with black girls (he claims that he is racist the whole relationship), step dad/dad/mom category and i just feel like i have been with an animal until now. he is just peacefully sleeping in our bed while i am crying holding onto my last straw in the living room asking myself why? why am i here again? since we moved here, he lied about his female coworkers, he was meeting her everyday, eating with her alone, meeting with her alone, keeping her as a secret away from me. he made me change my phone number - i did. he made me delete and block my years long friends from league of legends - i did. i moved into another country because of him where i do not know the language and because of corona finding a job was impossible. i am here stuck in a loop, i feel like i am in hell. i really do believe that i am in one. and i cannot anymore, i cannot for months anymore but it doesnt go away. he forced me to hate everyone so no one is a threat to him and to our relationship - and now after 2 years my brain is programmed to hate everyone. i cannot stand one living creature on this planet. i go out and i despise every woman that i see because i believe that my boyfriend would instantly cheat on me with her if he could. i caught him shamelessly staring at other women in front of me so many times… i feel threatened by his every talk with a woman, coworker, retail workers, post, anyone. everyone is a threat to me and i hate everyone that makes me smile and laugh and give him something that apparently i cannot give to him. yes i know that i am mentally ill, but it was a result of all the events that happened to me through my life. i feel like i am going insane, i avoid people as much as i can, i try my best not to say a word to anyone, i avoid even sitting next to a male in a tram/bus. all i ever wanted was to be all to someone, to be enough and to be worth of everything. yes i do know that i have nothing to offer because my will for life has died long time ago, but dont i deserve to be free and released from all of this? i hate myself, i hate every atom of my living body. i am bad at so many things and i get discouraged by every small inconvenience. i cannot anymore… i really cannot… there is so much more to this and if anyone wants to talk with me in depth or help me - please, please help me. i am at the point where i have to beg this from strangers on reddit. i didnt know where and to who else i could turn to. there is much more to what my boyfriend did to me but right now my mind is too scrambled to even think straight. i will write it later or explain it to people if anyone gives me a chance. i just cannot leave him, i have nowhere to go - my parents dont want me and i dont know anyone else. i have 200 euros on my bank account and i own barely anything. i live in austria and i do not know german and have been struggling with finding a job - i had few opportunities and 3 of them wanted for me to have sex with them in order to get a job, because i guess mens mindset is that i was already miserable enough to do that just for the sake of the job. then new lockdown, then more of the bullshit, it is impossible to find a job. i genuinely do not see a way out of this. what am i supposed to do? i cry and cry and cry, and cry more, i am surrounded by mess, uncleaned dishes, onvacuumed floor with barely any food left in the fridge. i have no energy or will to exist. why would i even? how do i get out of this? please someone help me, i am lost and i am scared to live like this my whole life, i can barely get through the day anymore. someone please help me, be it mentally, through talking, financially, any type of way, please…  there is much more to this than i wrote, i am just in so much pain and i dont see myself being able to survive one more day, my heart sinks so deep in my body and hurts so bad, i tried to convince myself that i can at least love myself but how can i if no one ever even tried to love me?

i think my mom is purposely holding me back from seeing a specialist,Degenerate_Senpai,"i've never had a mental diagnosis in my life, but i know i have depression. my mom knows i have depression. i've had it for the longest and i think it's started to have a deeper affect on me than before. problems that didn't exist the previous year are now manifesting, like me confusing left for right and saying something completely different from what i read or what my mind intends for me to say. long lasting problems have pursisted, problems that makes me either overthink or think too little and it lessens my skills of paying attention to my surroundings, following instructions correctly, recalling events and information, and comprehending certain conversations. my mom is aware of these problems and is very quick to calling me out for misunderstanding certain instructions and tasks. i notice these problems pursists when i'm around her, and it feels like i have to walk around eggshells to make sure these problems don't happen or else i'm going to awaken the gordon ramsey inside of her. she often complains how many times she's had to correct me on certain things and even yells, ""i refuse to believe my son is this mentally challegned to understand this basic, simple thing!"" i've told her many times that these problems are hard to avoid, and it's not like i'm conscious to what i'm doing wrong. it's something outside of my control and at this point, after all these years of making the same mistakes, this is something i need to talk to a specialist about, because i believe it's either my depression or a mental disorder or two preventing my mind from working at times. my mom says the same thing in response, ""okay, your medical insurance should cover seeing a specialist/ okay, we can look into doing that/ okay, we need to find some specialists in the area that you can talk to."" despite this, she's still quick to call me out for these same problems and still treats them as if i'm conscious to avoiding them even though i'm not. she does nothing to help me find a specialist despite what she says and i think it's on purpose. you see, my mom is physically and emotionally abusive. i've endured a lifetime of abuse. this is a mom who threatened to stab me with kitchen knives as a discipling tactic when i was 8-13 years old. not even for discipling, but for anything. if i had a stomache and i cried too much, she'd tried to shut me up with the knife. if she believe i'll say no to something, she'll use the knife to make sure i say yes before trying anything else. this is a mom who scratched my neck, punched and slapped me and threatened to call the cops on me despite her doing all the abuse and me trying to move away from her. this is a mom who publically berated that 'she hated me and i should go live with my deadbeat father.' if i did see a specialist, i think one inevitable question they ask is what's my relationship with my mother like? and recapping all the abusive stories would get my mom in trouble after years of her getting away with it. if she's not worried about getting in trouble, then i believe she just doesn't like the idea of me possibly talking about her behind my back. whatever the case may be, it feels like my mind is deteriorating everyday and i'm tired of having these problems being treated as if they're something i'm conscious to recognizing and avoiding, especially being around a mom who's so quick to jump on you before mistakes even happen and provoking anger in you. she's what leads to misunderstandings most of the time, not wanting to make herself understandable nor approaching the way she says things to be understood, and my brain is poorly adjusting to it or something? at this point, i feel like i need to act crazy in order to get her to take me to a specialist or something. even if i need to break shit and even get arrested as a way of telling her 'there's something mentally wrong with me!'",2.0,0.0,1600098427.0,depression

am i beyond real recovery?,throwra5296,"hey all.i wanted to gauge how messed up i really am by telling my story for people;i was raised in a regional area of australiai had a cousin whom i was very close to die from a rare form of leukaemia in his mid 20s when i was 13.it was a very long and painful death for him and i was there to witness the worst of it.it made my father's drinking even worse, and my mother left - and because of all this i dropped out of high school and went into home schooling until the mandatory year 10.because we lived in a lone house, in a paddock, well outside of town my social interactions were severely limited and it was pretty much just me and my father there until i was 18 and managed to get out on centrelink (the dole) as a full time student.those 5 years were very damaging i feel - and even now at 30 i can't seem to escape the grasp of what that time alone did to me.i was in melbourne during all the lockdowns (most locked down city in the world apparently - over 270 days) it brought back a lot of that emotional intensity in me and has left me feeling deeply alone and antisocial,  and just worn down (plus broke).i have had the good grace of a wonderful therapist and the government subsidy, but most of that was just like a kind of emergency first aid to calm me weekly or fortnightly and i never got to make as much progress with it as i would have liked.i have a deep deep hatred in me for my mother abandoning me and my father for a whole list of things (keeping me trapped for one thing) so my relationship is non-existent with dad, and my mother tries, but i just can't let her in (i've had the term ""ambivalent attachment "" used by my therapist on this)i feel like i'm at the end of my tether and now the last of my youth is gone and i spent most of it just trying to survive with my overbearing mind so i see myself as woefully under accomplished compared to so many of my peers.(i have friends and an ex gf from when i studied who have done some truly incredible things since my time knowing them)i'm skipping a couple of other things in here but that's the meat of it essentially.i just don't know.would love some thoughts from people on all of this.thank you.",1.0,0.0,1638610254.0,depression

i feel wronged and depressed for being a human with emotions.,Stark27_,"due to depression i lost a friend of 7 years. this happened back in early june.you’d think i’d let go of this entire situation by now (december), but not really… the reason why i hold on is because her and i’s friendship meant a lot to me, but now if anything now i sort of feel resentment for being mistreated by her in the first place... maybe writing this will help me let go. i am hoping for some opinion or feedback of some sort.so this year has really pushed my emotional limits to their max. over the course of the past 2 years i have lost 4 loved ones to death... turns out i had one hell of a time letting them go (i never lost loved ones throughout the course of my life). i live out of state from the majority of my family to build my career and some day i plan to return with more experience. with the pandemic happening i never got to attend any of their funerals due to the fear of potentially making my other loved ones sick with it (i worry about their health and my own, i also simply did not want to be a reason my other loved ones got sick) and due to some restrictions my job had imposed to prevent the spread. basically, i never got the closure i personally needed... # what happened:after receiving my vaccination for covid, a friend of 7 years and i scheduled a trip to visit with each other. i should point out right away that i loved her… i had feelings for her (which may have scared her away idk) which i simply just wanted to reveal to her, whether something came from it or not didn’t matter too much because i waited for perhaps too long to say anything about it.i live out of state from her (my friend) and my family. i did take a vacation to go see them all. when i witnessed the resting place of my 4 loved ones who passed, it depressed me quite a bit. this was just a couple days before the trip my friend and i took planned out.during the trip, things went ok for the majority of it, but towards the end is where things began to crumble. see at the time i had a fear of rejection (the fear was strong enough to be scared of even the assumptions i had). i cried myself to sleep that night not only because i was grieving from missing my deceased loved ones but also because i started experiencing a post-traumatic stress episode of traumatic things that happened in my past... lets say i didn't choose to grow up within a dysfunctional family. never has this happened to me before. literally felt like my past came back to haunt me mentally in addition to the grief i was already feeling. i know she saw me in this depressed state and she didn’t help me in any way, although she didn’t have to, but a good friend would ask what’s wrong right? the next morning i did attempt to tell her my feelings while being emotionally overwhelmed (crying) and she spoke harshly towards me telling me i was too stuck inside my head with a rude tone of voice. like she was disappointed by me being this way. this made my depression so much worse. with as much pain as i was already feeling and that on top of it, i acted back defensively with what felt like instinct. (i didn't physically hurt her by the way, let make that clear). this eventually led me to ending the friendship out of projection (i felt like a unworthy friend so i thought i'd may as well get it over with), she took what i said fully seriously (which is understandable i guess). i regretted saying this with all my heart and made it known to her not very long after (a couple hours). i don't think this would have happened if she was more understanding of what i was experiencing. i wasn't crazy, i was hurting.... a lot.she lectured me which eventually led us to arguing with each other. she didn’t act like she was on my side but maybe she was trying to help. she only made my depression worse. basically, she started a fire. thing is, it seemed like she tried to put this fire out, but she couldn't (made it worse) and well eventually just ran away and let it burn (let me put out what she started), telling me to get help as she exited and blocking me from pretty much everything while at it. she made me feel like complete crap, made my already existing depression worse, made me feel stupid, made me feel significant.... like less of a man. left me in a very depressed state to the point where i couldn't eat for days, self-care was a huge challenge and keeping my place clean was also a huge challenge. the little motivation i could scape up from the bottom of the barrel was used to keep from losing my job and the life i worked so hard for the past 7 years to achieve. i didn't want it all to fall apart. i did seek help have been sticking with it for the past 6 months (therapy). at first i thought it was all my fault, overshadowed with overwhelming guilt but now i see that it was my depression taking me over. gradually, as i healed (6 months of therapy later), the more i realized that she played a part in all this (making my depression worse). it almost seems like she wanted to end it anyways, but then again… i think she didn’t realize what she was actually doing and neither did i. i’ve seen the best in her and i believe her and i are fully capable of putting it behind us, but she's currently handling it in an immature way from what i've heard from other friends and some family.i want to believe what happened was perhaps a misunderstanding. i didn’t intend any unethical behavior, but that’s just how depression can affect me i suppose. it was scary. negative thought after negative thought. thoughts shape your reality. i feel ok today with the occasional depression spell (they are not as serious as they were at the beginning, best wishes to those who feel this way as a living... you deserve the best). my feelings for her persist because of hope, but i'm starting to see all my efforts of having a chance of reconciliation as hopeless. i feel wronged for being a human with emotions... sure i didn't handle it super well but neither did she. i at least tried to fix things. getting over her has been perhaps the biggest challenge of my life and i still have not done this entirely. i'm working on becoming a better person. i'm working on healing and working towards what makes me happy. i've learned a lot during these past 6 months. i just wish she was still my friend. it has been a very overwhelming road to recovery. i only wish she would talk to me to overcome this potential misunderstanding because i do miss her and friendships of 7 years don’t always come and go as they are very rare. i don’t know what went through her mind, but i know pain was only going through mine.# the questionswhat do you all think? do you think i should attempt to reconcile? or should i just move on entirely?  maybe i’m just afraid to grow and i just need to be told this.  at this point though i do feel frustration and some anger for being wronged like that. i want to confront her and call her out for treating me like dirt and for what she has done and i am very tempted to next time i return back to my home state (no violence btw) to get it off my chest and put out the last flame. i think it would help me get over her but i also don't think its the best solution and i could use some advice. do you think she needs to be called out for putting an old friend down to the lowest he has ever been in his life?  any help would be greatly appreciated!",1.0,2.0,1583212703.0,depression

could i be depressed without noticing?,throwaway_im_keeping,"_not my actual account because it is known amongst friends._hey everyone, hope you're all doing okay!yesterday i came to the realization that i might be depressed without having been aware of it, if that is even possible. i showed egocentric behaviour yesterday but i'm pretty sure i'm not because i feel empathy towards people all the time.i have a narrow focus. if i focus on something i forget most other things going on in life at the same time. i think this is why i have trouble with memory too. yesterday my gf and i were together for 6 months. we were making plans to hangout in the evening but because we couldn't do it at her place it meant i'd have to pick her up and bring her back which is a combined trip of 120km's. as i have been careless with my money for far too long and have been driving way way way too much i decided i should stop driving back and forth 4 times because if i keep it up it's just going to become way too expensive. being so absorbed in my finances, i completely forgot about our being together 6 months. normally that would be a reason to discard saving money and just go nonetheless, obviously. but it wasn't until it was already late in the evening i realized what a stupid fucking mistake i had made. how shortsighted and inconsiderate i had been towards my gf. i feel terrible about it. she doesn't deserve that and she was even being compassionate about me needing to stop being so careless about the amount i drive/spend. i absolutely hate myself for it eventhough it's not something i did on purpose, i just wish i hadn't fucking forgotten. she didn't and doesn't deserve it :( the thing is i was well aware of our being together 6 months, it's the first thing i told her in the morning, yet i'm completely oblivious to it in the evening.she motivates me to get this problem i have sorted out because hurting her is the last thing i would ever want to do, yet i do it, just not on purpose.i have a shitty sleeping schedule, and i almost always wake up with a clouded mind feeling dreadful. even after a perfect night's sleep.i eat terribly irregular. sometimes i don't have breakfast or lunch, or both for that matter. i've lost 3kg whilst i have been working out, which means overall i just eat too little.i lack motivation in my education and i'm experiencing (mostly social) anxiety. i'm the last person to be anxious i always thought of myself but i figured i just changed and am an anxious person now. however, when i talk to childhood friends, my gf, or people i am close with regularly, i am not anxious at all and i am reminded that i used to be like that in every aspect of life. open, not anxious, extraverted. nowadays i fuck up conversations with people in the gym because it stresses me out. the person i was is still here but i'm struggling immensely to be at peace with the way i am as of this moment.i thought these were all just things that changed in me and that i had to fix myself, but i'm beginning to feel like something has to be the cause of this, because despite my efforts i cannot seem to get out of it. the struggle has been going on for since before covid and it is dreading me. i'm tired of it, i want to just be my lively self again(, which sometimes comes back for like an hour at random). i want to stop hurting my gf by forgetting things she (and i too for that matter) value. it also makes me feel so selfabsorbed to be busy with my own problems all the time but i feel like i have to in order to fix myself.what do you guys think? is there an underlying cause here? or do i just need to stop thinking so much and start giving my all to get out of this regardless of how it makes me feel? thanks in advance everyone, stay well.",1.0,1.0,1638603713.0,depression

questioning myself,Braden675,"i know this is long, but i'm going to put it in here just to see what feedback i get.   i'm a thirty year old male and i have been questioning my sexuality for years. up until almost two years ago i lived in a very abusive household where i literally lived in a room with the door locked almost all day and night because i was harassed daily by a father who quit his job and retired in his forties and has been last two decades almost sitting around all day and night become irrational and disconnected from reality. i was told he was bipolar but i never believed it because he never did anything about it. this is a person who literally sits outside of the room downstairs or in the hall until i come out to go to work or school and to verbally and emotionally abuse me twenty four hours a day. in some ways it was like living in the turpin house if you're familiar with that situation.his goal was literally to frustrate me so much i would leave and have to be on the street homeless because it's expensive where i am and he knows this was probably going to be my situation. literally i could have no friends over, not leave for extended periods of time, nor socialize in almost any respect because this was going on in my household or if i was seen with someone it would be brought up.this started when i was in middle school and went on until i left two years ago almost. my mother did nothing about it and literally lives there still despite being divorced for almost a decade. my other family did nothing about nor anyone else. almost no one i knows this is how i lived through school and college. it was my problem as an adult to those who had to handle it. i've cut off sections of my family as a result. needless to say for years i've had massive issues with depression, self-esteem, identity, and otherwise for years. i have really no friends now and moved out as the pandemic started with the isolation and lock down periods.there was absolutely nothing that brought me positivity each day. when i was nineteen i started to look at porn. most of it became gay porn because it was literally the only thing that would get me up during the day. it's only certain acts in porn too that i get used to. i had to masturbate just to be motivated to even get up. this created an addiction that has lasted over a decade. i told my other about this issue who is a christian when i was twenty three. she was somewhat understanding, but never really listening to me on the situation. there were times we argued over it.for the past two years i've started working on ending the addiction because i moved out. i've never really known what i am sexually. during all of these years i've never had a lust for someone in person, no crushes or infatuates with anyone of any gender, or similar feelings. over time a few encounters with guys who were interested in me happened at parties and stuff when i actually was able to get out, but i don't reciprocate those feelings. i did it just to see how i felt and actually be kissed by someone, literally anyone because it's never happened and between my past living situation and the pandemic have never been able to find anyone all and spend time to figure this out further. we kissed, it felt hollow.they gave me some head, also nothing to it and hold me. the times that has happened it's just like two pieces of meat laying together. it's hollow, empty, and similar. i've had no feelings for any of these individuals in any for except maybe a warm feeling after being kissed but it seems to pass after a short time. is this from doing something instead of being alone all the time? i feel like i only did it to be bicurious and to see what the body contact felt like. it wasn't very interesting to me at all and like i said is pretty much just hollow. i don't get hard during any of this almost either. it's difficult to do to say the least.it was part of the reason i stopped using porn because i realized i couldn't see myself with a guy. i've never done anything sexually with anyone besides these few encounters. there's never been any form of intercourse because i've never been into it and don't want to do that with another male. it just don't have a desire for it.during the past six months as i've stopped looking at any pornographic material i've had instances where i will meet a girl for a few minutes and i will think they are pretty almost kind of like i was under a spell where i wanted to talk to them more and get to know them. it's happened a few times now i had never experienced a feeling like this until now. this has never happened with a male. it's like an invisible feeling or spell comes over me and i want to know them more.i've been able to bring the addiction down to the point where i am no longer actively looking at new porn material and am in what they call the flatlining period where i have no sex drive, but also now depression, anxiety, and similar feelings. i've gotten sick of looking at porn basically and want nothing to do with it.during that time i've looked at straight porn and actually started masturbating to girls and seeing myself into them. i don't know how to explain this and why this has happened in the ways or order it did. i can't see myself being in a relationship with a male. i have no emotional connection to any of those i've played around with. my instinct is forming a relationship with a female and seeing where it goes instead. i don't think this is just social pressure, but what my natural interest is. i feel like i never was given square odds to see what i am or is going on because there's always been chaos in my life from start to finish.",1.0,0.0,1566033958.0,depression

i'm just doing worse and worse. that my life is a waste. that i am a complete and total failure and that it's too late to really turn my life around and live my dreams. too late to accomplish anything real. that i am a waste and a disappointment.** **i don't even know where to begin or what to say or in what order.** thinking perhaps i'll just make a list stating facts and feelings. guess i'll just do that. **then if something doesn't make sense, you, the redditors can ask for clarification.** if anyone takes the time to read what i feel will be a novel of a post and actually comments. **i'm pretty sure no one will want to take the year to read this but figured it wouldn't hurt to put it out there as i am at least venting. sorry for the novel but that's the only way i can convey how difficult of a time i am having.** anyway, here it goes. * have only commented on things on reddit a few times. no original posts. mostly just come here for video game questions and stuff like that. reddit is always super helpful and the people seem less toxic than many other sites. * i am a **28 year old female.** * i **graduated 10 1/2 years ago**. i graduated in may 2011. * i've lived in **utah** since i was only 1 1\\2 or somewhere around there, so pretty much my whole life.   * **do not fit in here.** i started dying my hair black in high school, my original hair color is a kind of darker, dull blonde. i got a third ear piercing on the cartilage. i wore tank tops and jeans, still do, it's my favorite thing to wear because it's comfortable. even as an adult these things are kind of taboo because of how intense the religion is here. so i have stood out a lot starting in high school. even now as an adult i'm not accepted because of the same things.    * **feel so trapped and looked down on and alone living in this state.**    * **have a ton of bad memories here.**   * **have wanted to move to california since high school.** my dad would take us there every so often because he grew up in san diego and i have always loved it there.       * **i've always wanted to become an actor and moving so southern california would be advantageous for that as well.** * i am **on 2 anti-depressants** and have been for the majority of the past five years. **they barely take the edge off. the edge being wanting to kill myself.** * **have experienced depression and anxiety my entire life.** i thought that was how everyone felt. i had no idea until i looked back and really thought about things or when i have brought it up with people and they said it wasn't normal. the realizations were over the years, starting in high school. i still have realizations sometimes when looking back at my life. here is one of the biggest realizations:   * have had specific anxieties since fourth grade when my best friend told me that she couldn't hang out with me or talk to me anymore because she wanted to be friends with the popular girls. they didn't like me apparently because they said they wouldn't be friends with her if she was still my friend.       * i have felt so lonely since that day. my entire life since then.* **my depression and anxiety have gotten many, many times worse and i now have ptsd. ptsd, not just for one but several events.** different types and different offenders. mostly from the two relationships after high school which add up to 6-7 years. the second of the two ended in 2017 but still affects me every day. i have had a few things happen after those two relationships, the most recent being in may. * **my depression, anxiety, and ptsd has gotten so bad that i can no longer work.** starting at the very beginning of october, i finally admitted to myself and even to my dad and step-mom that i can't function on my own anymore and that i really need help. they helped me apply for state assistance that very night and i now receive food stamps. i am trying to get assistance with rent, applying for disability, etc. since then. * **yesterday i legit started crying when a clothes commercial played on youtube...** i never ever have money for anything. i still have clothes from high school a decade ago with a lot of holes because **i can't ever buy myself anything.**    * **a heart condition popped up the autumn after graduating. i didn't know collections was a thing and i wasn't able to pay anything. my credit was destroyed before i even used credit. because of that, i have never been able to take out a loan for a anything ever.**       * obviously, **i don't have a car**, i have never been able to buy one. **i really, really wish i had a car. i never leave my apartment because of my ptsd. i am too scared** to walk anywhere alone and it takes weeks to be able to convince myself to leave and only if i have money for the bus. that is barely less scary for me, but enough to where i can convince myself to leave the apartment if it is for something really important.    * my two awful ex-boyfriends are another reason i have never had money. now it is solely because of my depression, anxiety, and ptsd.* i have had issues with self-harm since high school. part of it is the adrenaline high. guess i am an adrenaline junkie. thankfully i haven't over the past few years. * **i have felt so lonely my entire life, especially now.** people never talk to me first or ask to hang out. it's always me. hell, i try but no one really wants to. ever. i have one friend, who has been my friend since high school. but we only hang out 1, maybe 2, rarely 3, times a year anymore. it's been this way for several years. **i have tried making friends but it just doesn't work. i don't understand. because of this, i have a very hard time having a positive image of myself or have any self-esteem. i feel like something is wrong with me.** * **when i really think about it and am having some clarity and a little bit of freedom from the depression, anxiety, and ptsd, i feel that i am pretty, very intelligent, very talented, very strong, wise, loving, caring, loyal, protective, helpful, and sympathetic or empathetic or both (i can't ever remember the differences between the two), good at understanding people and what they are feeling as well as giving advice which almost always helps the person/people.** * **but most of the time lately i feel that i am ugly (even to the point where i avoid looking in the mirror at all), naïve, pathetic, failure, waste of space, burden, awkward, unlikeable, sad excuse of a human being.** * **i have 3 cats and i don't know what to do** to get financial assistance to pay for their needs. 2 of them are now having issues where they need to go to the vet but i don't have the money. i have considered finding new homes for them but they are the most effective anti-depressants in my life by far. whenever i think about it i start panicking and legitimately can't continue thinking about it. but i also want what's best for them. but then i think about how some people are terrible to their pets and i get scared. **they are my children, i really do feel that way.** i have had all of them for the majority of their lives. there ages are 11 or 12, 9 or 10, and 2 1/2 years old. **they are my babies. they are the reason i keep breathing. they are the reason i keep trying. i am scared of what might happen to my mind and life if i find new homes for them. i'm scared of what i might do.** * as i mentioned earlier, **i have always wanted to become a film actor.** while that is already extremely difficult in my situation without taking mental stuffs into play, it's way, way, way more difficult with the mental challenges. i don't have any connections with anyone in the business, i don't have any money for college/classes (of course i could benefit from it but don't need it), money for an agent, money to move to a state where there will be more, and better, opportunities. i desperately wish someone could just swoop me up and take me under their wing and help me try for my dream. someone who knows about the industry or, even better, have experience as an actor themselves.    * **i feel like finally getting to pursue and hopefully live my dream would help with my depression.** i think about acting every single day now. the past couple of years it just gets worse and worse. it's driving me nuts. yes, it's a full time job, but **i really do think i can do it because it is something that i am so passionate about.**    * **i haven't really pursued it because it is such a difficult career to break into and thought it would be stupid to pursue and that it would just be a waste of time. but now i feel deeply that it was a mistake and that i need to at least seriously pursue it, that i owe it to myself.** especially because i am really disappointed in myself for not going for it. **i also think i could do a good job if giving the chance.**    * but **i have no idea where to start and researching it has proven difficult with my depression and anxiety. but, i need to pursue it. it's a need at this point.**    * **i am fascinated with all things film making.** sound, visual effects, set design, costuming, and acting most of all, of course.    * i have many reasons that i would like to act. they aren't the superficial reasons that everyone assumes, they are legitimate emotional reasons   * **i am a gamer and have considered streaming.** haven't because i don't know if that could somehow have a negative impact on an acting career (probably just being paranoid) and also because i don't live alone and my roommate is usually pretty loud.       * maybe it could bring in some income? i doubt it would get to that point but you never know, right?      * i feel like maybe it could help me feel less lonely? which i feel pathetic sharing. i'm just desperate. ha**as i type, i am always thinking of more things and adding them here and there. as i am starting to feel quite exhausted mentally and pathetic, i will end this here.** **thank

why do people feel compelled to make my life worse than it already is,IamTheSwagCat,"i suffer from bipolar disorder and depression but typically im able to atleast keep myself going on a baseline level just through sheer inertia. i know that people leaving/abandoning me is one of my biggest triggers, which is why ive mostly cut myself off from others, easier to just be alone then to have someone come and then hurt me. recently i made the mistake of trusting someone and inviting them into my life, they made me feel valid and important and i didnt feel so focused on my body issues when they were around, but something just clicked and they changed their mind and decided i was no longer worth their time and now im spiraling and i dont know what to do. i dont understand what compels people to hurt me in this way, why not just leave me alone to begin with.",1.0,0.0,1374401290.0,depression
pls help,Kooky-Alternative668, i dated this girl from 15 to 20. i feel in love deeply stupidly. i was confident and fun n just happy human being.i went to college and she started dating a d1 football player an old friend the same time as me. when i found out and she chose him over me i have been having panic attacks and depressed out of my mind. i have tried to talk to other girls but i have no clue what to say or how to act or talk to girls in general. we got back together after all that and she broke up with me for the college experience.i’m 22 now and after she got broken up with she hit me up asking to be friends. i agreed and showed interest and we hung out three times and i tried to kiss her and act interested and she said she didn’t wanna complicate anything and she hates thinking about her feelings and i keep pushing. i hate myself for loving this girl. she is talking to many guys rn and probably using me as a back up plan. it hurts so bad i hate myself so much for loving her. i can’t take her choosing someone over me again. i have panic attacks and just feel completely dead already. i lost my old self . i’m working at my fathers plumbing company now as a apprentice plumber and living with my parents in my hometown i lost all my friends and have no one. i go to the gym and that’s about it.  i’m a loser still in love with a cheating ex and probably will never find love.,2.0,0.0,1601519280.0,depression
what are my next options if intensive outpatient programs did not help?,JamesGreer13,"this outpatient program has felt like a waste of money and it feels fake and commercialized. the help i received there didn’t feel genuine.i’ve tried everything. i take medication consistently (even switched them up when the previous ones didn’t help). i’ve been in excellent shape before, but this didn’t help, and in fact made me insecure because girls finally liked me. i went to college, but failed out of my program despite taking advantage of all of the resources available to me and trying my best (engineering). i then switched to a different major but found that not very easy either and failed multiple classes. i despise working and doing the same monotonous thing every day for hours on end, and without a degree know that i’m barely going to make it in life, so i’d rather not work full time just to barely survive.i’m not even sure if i want to be happy. this is the only identity i have. it’s all i’ve known.",2.0,0.0,1498471971.0,depression
"probably gonna fail this year, i'm relatively mentally stable at least",Ill_Highlight_633,"same old story as always, i got lazy and let everything spiral out of control. now i have to solo several group projects under a few days since my defective arse can't be bothered to function like a normal person instead of an old flickering flashlight you have to slap around to work. the mini heart attacks that comes packaged with social interaction when not so utterly sleep-deprived are so entertaining as well. wish it would do me in one day so i can finally get this all over with.time either crawls around like a slug or blitzes right pass me in a blink of an eye. they all blend together in an incomprehensible sludge which do not help my shitty memory at all. is it today or tomorrow? i have no fucking clue sometimes. tick, tick, tick, time fell out of the cuckoo's nest. it just keeps running out and that's that. how did i think going to a prestigious school was ever going to work? aside from some frankly mediocre creative writing skills, i have nothing to bring to the table. luck was all i ever had if i'm being honest and even that is running out. they were all right. should've stayed right in your lane, useless idiot.maybe i should drop out and start again next year when i finally muster up enough energy to play a character that vaguely resembles something functional. my dad certainly suggested that, though my brain registered that as a threat. haha, stupid little thing. it keeps wasting money.on the bright side, i've already started distancing myself from my friends so at least getting left behind won't hurt so much. i doubt it would even affect me at this point since i automatically repress any inconvenient emotions at this point. crying never solved anything after all.i know this long ramble sounds frankly concerning, probably grounds for therapy or something. not that i'll ever go. still, it all reeks of something going wrong with the collection of red flags i call a brain, but compared to last year i'm downright stable. just wanted to scream into the void for a hot minute.but hey, my academic life might be slowly dying in forgotten ditch somewhere, at least i'm not thinking of picking up cutting, staring at bridge pictures, or passively planning jumping off one. now i just stare at fish pictures for some reason. fish are nice. i count that as an improvement.",2.0,1.0,1621192193.0,depression
