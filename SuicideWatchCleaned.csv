i hate myself,keumdongskiee,"i hate myself so much and  i hate that i turned out like this. everything about me is so bad i wish that i was just another person instead. all i do is burden everyone and drag them down. i'm convinced that everyone hates me and that everyone would be so much better if i just didn't exist at all. i push everyone away because i don't want them to be associated with an ugly and terrible person like me, but sometimes i cant help but feel lonely. everything would be solved and be so much better if i just died, plus i won't have to worry about what everyone thinks anymore.",1.0,0.0,1638713332.0,73382951.0
My Brain Is Trash,Financial_Advisor500,"Here I am writing this on a Sunday morning where I have visitation with my daughters. They’re both elementary age and are still asleep in my bed. We can’t go to church this morning because my older daughter and I both have a fever. They both go back to my ex-wife’s house this afternoon.I’ve gotten no sleep because of headaches, coughing, and being given little room in the bed. My apartment is a wreck because I have too much stuff from when I used to have a house and because my girls have spread stuff all over it since Friday night when they arrived. Both of these have me in a vague state of general agitation.I work a regular 8-5 job which I’m grateful for. What I’m not grateful for is that I’ve been working 7:30-6 with no lunch because one of my co-workers quit a month or more ago and my boss just had her last day last Tuesday. That took a staff of 4 down to 2 and now yours truly is the de facto boss. All of the responsibilities with none of the experience, support, or pay.I’ve been struggling with borderline personality disorder, addiction, and suicidal thoughts for years. They’ve been managed pretty well recently but I’ve been cracking. We watched The Santa Clause 2. I cried. We watched Home Alone. I cried. I read an article about Alabama football. I cried. I’m cracking.And now I don’t care. I’m tired of this dirty apartment. I’m tired of being sick and not even being able to call out from work like I should. I’m looking at my pills wondering why I bother. I’m looking at my daughters cramped in my bed in this stupid apartment sleeping soundly. They’re better off with their mom. They’re better off without me. I’m ready to go. Someone take me out. I don’t think I can do it myself. I’m scared of hurting my loved ones but I just can’t go on.",0.0,0.0,1638712856.0,30315481.0
Idk if I can carry on.,SCATOL92,"I should preface this with, I am pregnant and having an abortion next week. I feel fine about that. There is a possibility that this is all hormonal. I feel like I am unable to do anything right. I am failing as a mother. I'm failing as a wife. I had to take off sick from work last week so that's something else I am failing at. I have no friends. I exist to serve my family and I am so so bad at that. My 2.5 year old child cannot talk at all. He cant understand the concept of a crayon. He is destroying my house because he is so bored. Because I dont know what to do. I cant do it right. I just keep thinking that they would all be so much better off without me. My kid might actually have a chance if I'm our of the picture. My husband might be happier without having to deal with my crying and worrying all the time. I feel like I'm wasting my kids childhoods being so so miserable. But I cant remember how to be happy. I just dont want to be here.",1.0,0.0,1638712125.0,27209788.0
I'm ready to die,readytodie_,"I've lost so much this year. My girl graduates college next Friday, I bought a diamond bracelet when she started college to give to her when she graduates. My son has found his own path, a good one. I'm so proud of the both of them, I love them without measure. My husband was a good man, or so I thought. A tryst with the town home wrecker and stolen kisses with other women, and years of online sexting has devastated what I thought to be a good marriage... I  never expected perfection, but I did expect respect. I cannot live a life where I am always questioning everything. I had never questioned his love and devotion so this was the heaviest of blows. I cannot start again. I've lost my profession. I can no longer work doing what I loved doing, my health has deteriorated to the point that I am no longer a productive member of society. I never thought this would happen to me. I am trapped mind, body and soul. I have nothing to look forward to except a crippling disease that will leave my family to care for me, I cannot accept that.  I've saved up enough of my medication to peacefully pass away in my sleep. I will attend my daughter's graduation, wrap Christmas presents, decorate the house, list out who gets what of mine (a simple Will), order birthday presents for next year and tidy up odds and ends before I take my leave. ""A lady always knows when to leave"" is one of my favorite quotes and it's time for this lady to take her leave.Thank you for taking time to read this, I simply could not verbalize it.  \*edit - I've cashed out my retirement to leave my husband debt free and the remaining will cover the cost of cremation/basic funeral, I didn't want to leave my family in debt or having to worry about funeral expenses.",3.0,2.0,1638712028.0,2863.0
A door,garthjmoore,"I tried to describe suicide to someone. My father committed suicide in my backyard at dinner time when I was 8. It was like being in a room with all my friends and suddenly my father walked in and a door appeared on the wall out of nowhere and he walked through it and was gone. None of my friends can see the door, but I can. And I’m scared that someday I’ll walk through it, too and show it to my kids.",1.0,0.0,1638711685.0,59358283.0
