"25f , depressed since 17. i tried my best i can’t anymore.",R4ven4,"it all started from early school years when i was an overweight kid in a boarding school experiencing bullying and complete loneliness for many years. i put all my effort and focus into changing that and at 17 i became thin and beautiful only to discover how much better people treated me just for that. it didn’t make me happy or be proud of myself. instead i’ve felt lonelier than i ever did before. something in my brain broke and i got bad depression which destroyed everything i was within the next 8 years. i kept losing and gaining weight and it kept going from getting attention and friendships, relationships, to becoming completely invisible and alone. neither option shelters you from the misogyny and the absolute misery of being a woman in this world. i hate my body to the point that i don’t go outside anymore and i always wear a face mask to hide. i have isolated myself from everyone and have now been in self-imprisonment for 2 years. basically no one knows i exist or what i look like so leaving will be easy. i had so much to offer, smart , musically talented, funny but no one will ever take my qualities or my personality seriously unless i keep myself pretty. every man that claimed to love me threw me out like trash as soon as i had periods of bad depression where i couldn’t keep up my attractiveness up for a while. you don’t recover from your husband  who promised to love you for better and for worse knowingly leaving you to kill yourself with a cocktail of pills in your hand. i couldn’t do it then but i am not scared now. my soul is broken beyond repair and its time for me to go. i really did give it my best shot.",11.0,7.0,1548881491.0,suicideWatch

venting my feelings,Eluest,so i’m a 24 m and every now and then i erupt into pretty depressing sessions of just despair and crying alone to the point of wanting to be dead. i’m only passively suicidal not actively but i can’t help but feel like maybe that’ll change someday. i have a suicide note written on my phone that i continuously update every now and then and it makes me feel some kind of comfort but at the same time feel despair that this may be my only true way out of this misery. i’ve never done therapy before and really want to because i know i need it and i’ve been trying to find one but it’s so difficult with the pandemic and all. either there’s no one available or nobody answers. a lot of these problems and feelings stem from my what i’d consider to be severe anxiety and how it controls my life. the most recent thing is that i’ve entered a relationship that i’m happy with but my anxiety leaves me feeling like i’m not fully enjoying the relationship and motions. this anxiety leaves me feeling like i’m not good enough and like i’m making mistakes left and right and reading to much into things etc etc and afraid the relationship will crumble at any given moment and i’ll be left all alone again. i understand these feelings are counter productive and self destructive to a relationship and it’s why i’m trying to control them even when it’s really difficult. it’s the kind of feelings that arose or got more severe when my gf and i talked about where we’re at and what needs to be worked on and improved between us because we both want a long term relationship with each other and and that’s when i truly realize how much work really needs to be put into a relationship for it to work and develop in a healthy way and i’m just afraid that i won’t live up to that. im certainly working on shaking off these feelings of self doubt and self destructiveness but still. also i’m trying to change my life around from my current place because i’m not satisfied with where i’m at but i’m afraid i might never be able to change it despite how much i really want to and i’m currently trying. it’s the kind of thing that makes me feel hopeless and feel like if this is my life until i die then what’s even the point?,8.0,1.0,1635302747.0,suicideWatch
to the love of my life: an explanation,Jamiebedford01gb,"you were always right. im intense, im clingy, im needy. i will never not be in disbelief that i'm no longer with you. i think you have seen how calm i can be - perhaps even too laid back - but we both know that's only when things go smoothly. life unfortunately isn't like that and i can't react like this every time there is a challenge. i wish i wasn't like this because i know how unhealthy it is for everyone but it's the brain i was blessed with.these days i'm now have this weird sort of anhedonia. i know i have many things that used to make me happy that don't directly involve you but yet i dont see the point, the motivation, and i can't enjoy anything if i know i can't tell you about the thing that is making me happy, the thing that i did, the goal i'm working towards, the thing i achieved, the emotion i felt, or the thing i laughed at. nothing makes me feel anymore. i have lost all motivation to do anything but try and be with you and that is wrong. and as much as i am sorry for what this will cause, this is why i have to do this. my only drive is to be with you and therefore i'm scared that all my future has in store is harassing you, releasing my anger and desperation on you, and hurting you. this is for myself in the sense i don't want to spend my days being known as an abuser or as a convict. but it's also for you. i want the best for you and i don't want to hurt you any longer. i want you to be the happiest that you can be. and i know this will cause pain initially but in the long run i think you will be better off compared to if i was here.we both promised we would never leave and i know i have let you down in doing this. i know i could carry on heartbroken and try and rebuild the pieces back in my life i could. but i don't want to. i just don't have the will power anymore. i am so weak and in too much pain. i will slowly get stronger just for my mind to shoot me back down again and again. i hope you will forgive me. i believe it is the best thing for both of us. i always wanted you to be happy and i would do anything to make that happen. and this is what it takes. i have always been willing to die for you and this is one of those rare circumstances where the person has to commit to that oath. i love you, emily. i know you loved me too at one point, i really do. and i feel so blessed to have experienced your love. it made me the happiest i have ever been. i guess i never realised how unfulfilled and incomplete i was before you came into my life. and i know in the end your love had changed. at least to extent it wasn't strong enough to want us to work. to want to try. to battle through the difficult, unnatural times for a future with me. but that doesn't change my feelings for you. i am in such awe of you that nothing ever could make me not think you are the most special person in the universe. you are far too good for me. you deserve so much better. i love you too much to deny you that. i hope you remember me and the good times we had together. the growth we had as a couple. the things that we brought to each other. the things we changed about one another. the new hobbies we shared. the life we had. i hope you will think of me positively. one last kiss, jamie x[link to weyes blood - 'be free'] - one of my favourite songs, i love it even as much as my love for tame impala.",2.0,1.0,1573154129.0,suicideWatch

need some help,Wichita92,"everyone…i really need your help. i’ve never been the one to turn to the internet and random people for reassurance or advice, but i’m in a really low spot.i’ve read almost every single thing about suicide at this point. the devastation it causes to loved ones, the permanence of an unthinkable action. and even though there are days where i feel so depressed that i sometimes wish i wasn’t alive anymore, i could never ever go through with an action that would hurt those around me.that’s the problem, you see i’m very aware of my actions. im very aware that i have a family who loves me dearly and would do anything for me. i’ve voiced my depression and anxiety to them for years and have been very transparent. i’ve seen about 8 different psychiatrists, therapists, psychologist and social workers and nothing has helped. i’ve read self help books. i’ve tried multiple ssri’s and antidepressants, anti-anxiety meds and adhd meds (all of which had no reaction or made my condition worse…aka the worst depression i’ve ever felt). i’ve worked out consistently and made dietary changes. i’ve done so much and i know deep down is that any self-help needs me to stay diligent but i never put the work in (which can be blamed a lot on my diagnosed adhd). part of my depression is that i always feel lazy. i slack off at work, yet still continuously get promoted. i never do things if they’re too hard, i always try to find a shortcut.i hate that i need to have things a certain way or obsess over thoughts and consequences of my actions (i also have diagnosed ocd).truth be told, i just hate myself more and more. i was bullied for years growing up, i didn’t have many friends until i went to college. then i had a bunch and a girlfriend for a few years. when i left college i had made new friends and kept some. now ive lived in a new state for a couple years, have hardly made friends with anyone despite joining clubs, sports teams, work outings and so forth. i’m extremely social, i used to have no anxiety about conversation with total strangers and now, for the first time ever, i’m more and more nervous. i can’t meet a girl for the life of me. every time i do, they end up being an alcoholic, manipulative or don’t have enough in common with me.i just feel lost. i’m not happy anymore, at least not with any normal consistency like i used to have. i don’t want to continue, but suicide isn’t an option. i try to do things for myself all the time. i treat myself to things, like vacations and such. but i take them alone, so i feel like shit when i’m on them.i don’t know what to do anymore. prescriptions are no longer an option in my book (too many bad experiences and i’ve seen pharmaceuticals wreck havoc in my family). i’ve tried multiple holistic things too like ashwaghanda, and others to no avail. i have no motivation to see another counselor, or keep up with things like cbt.i know this just feels like a rambling vent…and for any who have made it this far i really appreciate you taking the time to listen to a stranger. quite frankly, i’m not sure i even know what i’m looking for by posting this. but i needed to say something because i’m hurting so much inside.",12.0,2.0,1638741849.0,suicideWatch
going to cali,Ericscott626,"i was thinking about taking a trip to san francisco. one of the places i'm very curious about is the golden gate bridge. i'm not interested in going during the day but i would love to go in the middle of the night, say around 2 or 3 in the morning. beautiful scenery. so beautiful in fact i wouldn't even mind if it was my last moment. however i've heard it closes early now. theoretically for anyone who's familiar with the area how difficult would it be for a person to get in at this time, what are some of the risks and are there any barriers and or fences that someone would have to worry about?",3.0,5.0,1543352574.0,suicideWatch

want to die but it would destroy my family - the burden i never asked for,searching4euphoria,"years and years of feeling this way but i know it would devastate my family and ruin their lives. they've told me as much. so instead i get to be stuck on this shitty planet that i never asked to be a part of to begin with. no job, no money, no friends, all my interests and passions have long since left me. i've been wasting away for years now in a basement and it gets worse every single day. there's no point to any of it and i don't want to play the game. just hoping i have a heart attack or something else 'natural' so i can be done with it. i'd say get run over by a bus but i'd actually have to leave the house for that to happen.",2.0,1.0,1637740084.0,suicideWatch

i dont even know,mckennamelder,"i have a couple classes that i can't seem to do anything good in. for context, i could be on the autism spectrum. i dont have a diagnosis but i do have autistic luke qualities. i ask for help they say refer to the rubric. i do i tell them that, then they explain and i sit there trying to form together the peices. i just can't. i try so hard to assume stuff and use my 'common sense'. but i don't have common sense. i have found myself losing motivation in my work and in my life. if i can't get through highschool then how can i do anything else? i constantly try and change how i do my work and study just so i can something correctly but i just fail. i can't find the will to partake on classes. i dont listen, i dont care. i dont want to do this because i am so fucking stupid. i've been writing in a journal to even out my emotions but it's barely any use when my antidepressants work very little. like damn, even high dosage of medication for my size doesn't work. am i that fucking pathetic? i hate the way i think, i hate the way it takes me so long to understand or sometimes never get it. now this is me, if people think like me but can prosper, that is all fine and well. i can't, at least not right now. the thread i hang onto is the love for my family and friends, although i find myself slowly pushing them away so when i do decide to go it won't be as bothersome to them. they would rather not have me if i'm a jerk, so that's the best i can do to not pass the pain of depression onto them. what is it that others do that i can't? what is hindering me and why do i feel hated. a part of me doesn't even know why i post here. i feel like i would boost people's godlike ego and that scares me. i'm so sick of trying. it's been months of constant sadness but i have been dealing with depression since the fifth grade. i'm tired of this i really am, i really don't want to do this. suicide sounds in a sense comforting because at least i won't have to deal with this. god but i would be selfish to my family and i can't do that to them. depression doesn't go away, it transfers when you decide to give up. that just makes me angry, i wish my death didn't have the consequences it did. fuck you god. you didn't have to do this to me.",5.0,0.0,1588457443.0,suicideWatch

i think today is the day,slightly-productive,"over the past 2 weeks, i’ve attempted to end my life 4 times. 2 of these attempts being a day away from each other. i’m surprised i’m still alive honestly. i’m very tired of existing. i’m very tired of being a headache to others and a problem. i’m tired of being this way all the time. i will never stop being this way no matter how hard i try. i hope it works today. if so, see you guys!i wrote something earlier that pretty much sums up how i feel:“suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem.”-phil donahueah, problems. the one that kicks me down in my attempts to climb out of the hole. a very dark hole. as i fall back into the hole, my impact as i hit the bottom makes the hole deeper somehow. this makes the hole permanent with no end. it is so deep that i can no longer see the sky above. i can only see a tiny white dot. a dot that gets smaller each time. i think as more time passes (maybe a few hours) that dot will be so small my eyes will be incapable of seeing it. you may argue i can fill in the hole with dirt. yet, how can i fill in a hole i cannot get out of the first place. how can i grab the shovel to pick up the dirt if i am stuck inside? hm. maybe i can scrape the dirt from the sides while i’m down here and eventually bury myself alive. wouldn’t that be nice? perhaps for others, this is a temporary problem. i’m not saying that it is not possible to come out of such a state. resilience exists in those people. i suppose the problem is that i will never have resilience. i can try (and believe me, i have countless times) but it will be a useless pathetic attempt at the end of the day. if i am not kicked back into the hole. the hole itself will chase me and engulf me. the problem is me. i am permanent so as long as i live. i want to become temporary through death - the permanent solution. my permanent solution.so respectfully phil, fuck you.",2.0,2.0,1617558568.0,suicideWatch
